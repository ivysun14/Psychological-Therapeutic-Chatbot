<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually there is this ring in my ear there (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there a (inaudible) arrow that points? An arrow points.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually this is nice because it's a (inaudible) view but this is - what there is, is a window.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There is some sort of a view I guess. It just reminds me of this story about the child that I remember as a child that the child that is sick and somebody brings a big flower on the wall across the window. Do you know that? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the O'Henry story?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's an O'Henry story.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to have gone through a bunch of different versions. Actually what you need is like a big Barnum & Bailey's ad there. But it's not yours so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Tigers. Clowns.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stuff like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The circus.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean its potential. You can see your ad here for how it is that the only people who are going to see the ad are the people in these offices.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't look like it's much (inaudible) down below.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh Yeah. It's upgraded every time since (inaudible) for sure.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: A lot of garbage cans.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot of garbage cans. Maybe ads for cat food or something like that is what he gets.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I really don't think that would be that effective. I mean there'll be - if the cats are there already to see the ad or already have enough food. It may be a message of homeless people. You know they could - they could be down there. But when everybody comes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I've been actually what has it been? Two weeks?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not in the office anymore. It's been awhile. (Inaudible). So it's a better because - well I guess it's better. I get to work on my programs, which is better. I suppose it's better. But.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said I suppose it's better? [2:40]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well it's better than being in the office because it's just not enough to say that I'm frustrated to not be able to do it. And actually I find that - that I'm sort of fighting all these other (inaudible). Every commitment is a little extra time here and there. And you have to sort of fight them all so to speak to have time to do some (inaudible) to do the stuff that I want to and get done. So it's actually if I can get it going - it will take a while. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could get what going? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'm going to get these pieces because (inaudible). Otherwise I'm not going to be able to do the prevent in May. It's one of the ... it's not a whole lot of time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's in May?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I plan to sell some music. But the problem that I have lately with this is that every time - every time I plan these things then it's - there's not quite enough time to get it done. And it's - it's always a battle to get them - all these other things which (inaudible). If I could just sort of move them out of the way for a while then it would be much easier. It's sort of not really practical. </p>

<p>I would much rather be doing - actually I would just prefer to just to drop (inaudible) for a while and just do the program. But I can't do that. There's the [Easter commute] (ph) which it just - Easter is just totally crazed in this church where I work. It just has (inaudibles) things (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Extra services and they get.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not just that there's extra stuff. It's the constantly having to arrange for something to happen and call people on the phone and get stuff together and. I just figure out how all of the details are going to (inaudible). If I stop and think about it and actually talk about it, it doesn't seem like an enormous amount of stuff. Doing it in as much detail but I don't know. [5:41]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look really troubled by this today.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you laughing at?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know as - I don't think I'm so troubled by these people. It's </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well actually I.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's bothering me is the.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like it's interesting. I said troubled by this. You heard troubled by these people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's I guess. Well that's what I was talking about, wasn't it? Talking about the annoying part of that job. And there's these people that - they (inaudible) this morning that if - the Christian idea of God is Heaven and Hell I suppose. And I was thinking that if they wanted to create Hell some place really wouldn't have to do much other than to just sort of turn people loose in Chicago and create Washington Heights and especially places like this, it would have - this is just perfect. I mean you would have to work in a place like that. And if you really get involved with this, it's unbelievably annoying. You just send all of the bad priests to this church and let them work there. And they would be (laughs) you know they would be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: None of it's purgatory or Hell but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it that bad?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's really annoying. It's - why is it so annoying? The comments (sighs) because they - they sort of have their own idea about how everything should be done. And what is it about it? It's like you go in there and sort of have to set aside everybody else's demands. And there's some sort of like nothing left. </p>

<p>And well I guess they wanted me there. They hired me because I could - because I could play. And then they thought because I could play I knew a lot about music. And because they thought I knew a lot about music then they thought that I knew a lot about running all of their music programs and which is all about children and liturgy and a bunch of stuff that I really don't know anything about. And then oh course if you don't, they get angry and - or raising money and I just can't deal with all of this in large. Because it's not the sort of thing that I wanted to do with - with sort of job. [8:36]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you saw yourself doing a lot of things you don't plan on doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There's a lot of stuff that I didn't. I mean what do I know about fund raising? Well I guess I got to do it. But somehow I decided that somehow I got to keep all of these crazy things that I don't really understand - to just sort of keep them at a distance enough so that I can at least do some of the things that I'm in this business to able to do. Otherwise it's nothing but just totally frustrating all of the time. (Inaudible) it might be bad. So. Some kind of road I just got to keep - I sort of got to keep them at bay. Like if I keep them at bay then it's bearable. But if I can't keep them at bay then I get caught up in everything else that's. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say them - those things or you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Those people. Actually it's the - it's the pastor that sets the tone and sort of (sighs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is there a possibility for you to say well this is not - I don't feel this is a part of my job and I don't want to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) Well actually it sort of kind of works that way in a sense because if they - if he sees another way of dealing with it and it's not really happening with me. Then he'll get somebody else to do it. But then the problem is that he may hire somebody else and then they end up paying me less. But really that's not so terrible. Just take less money and do less stuff. I can deal with that if I could work that route. Oh course getting there is - it would be nice to negotiate on a rational basis but the person's not rational. Just definitely not rational. [10:40]</p>

<p>(Laughs) The (sighs) I'm sure I mentioned this before that these complaints that suddenly materialize that's about available staff is making it really - this is (inaudible) and stuff that has nothing to do with any reality. It's just this came out of something else. Just whatever his mood is then. And then he'll plan to express all of the - anything that's retaliation - anything that can be used against you. That's why it's terrible. I just don't have any because of rationality there's no sense - there's no connection with reality. There's no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what does he have against you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He doesn't have anything against me. It's a he's a highly trained, highly motivated priest. And what they're supposed to do is push Jesus. And quite frankly if this is what Jesus is about, I want Jesus to leave me alone until (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean push Jesus?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pushing Jesus on me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Into you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know just push everybody into Jesus. I can deal without that. It's a.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just pushing Jesus onto you or into you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Into everybody. Well (sighs) no. Not so much. Not directly. But he figures - he figures that everybody should be - everybody should be working together to further his own goals because he identifies with - he identifies his goals with the church which I didn't realize his goals were.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So he has a lot of moral rationale as to why he wants you to do the things he wants you to do? [12:51]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I suppose. I suppose he does. It's just I don't - I don't - I really do not understand these people. They seem to be generally motivated to make everybody into the image that they want them to be. And oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I feel a little bit that I can't understand you today. You know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It wouldn't be the first time. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It wouldn't be the first time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) (Inaudible) no more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's true. What was said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you. And I'm not sure what's troubling you. It seems that you're telling it to me in a round about way. I feel that I sit here and I'm trying to figure out what you're telling me. And that there's a na�f and that I'm making an effort. It's not simple. Do you feel that you're telling me things kind of clearly and kind of straight forward? Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It's hard for me to figure out how to (clears throat). It's hard for me to figure out how to describe these things. It's like whenever it's (sighs) it's like I - the people who are there that are part of it I can relate it too but it's - I don't know. Maybe I just can't relate it to somebody who's not - who hasn't been there. If I could figure out a way to explain it. (clears throat) Well maybe it's you know maybe it's something that I just got to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel frustrated? Do you have any frustrated experiences that you're telling me about still? [15:04]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I just and I certainly realize that - that I can't quite create the - the whole atmosphere or the whole context of it. I mean it's - can't quite do it. I guess you have to be a storyteller or a good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It looks really hard. It looks like it's - it's hard for you. Looks like you're being uneasy. I can't.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I really want to do is just keep these people at a distance so to speak. Because it's very hard for me to know. Maybe if you never had - I can explain it to somebody who's tried to fight them off. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Someone who's been in a sense in the situation that you have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's easy. So. Yeah but if (laughs) if you haven't been in the same situation there's no - well maybe it's not even worth - worth trying to (sighs). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not worth trying to explain it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like when they're talking like I was at the staff meeting Monday and fortunately they don't ask my input too much anymore. (Inaudible) which I obviously have to deal with directly. And for about half an hour they were all sitting around and to me it sounded like they're all complaining about why aren't things that were the way they were when they were all in schools 30 or 40 years ago. (coughs) And they aren't. And I (inaudible). I was never in Catholic schools because I was in Chicago 30 or 40 years ago. So what do I have to think? But at the same time I'm thinking what they want is not what I want. I mean I have - I don't share their goals at all. I mean I didn't care whether they accomplished whatever it is they're going to accomplish. (Inaudible) for sure it would be such a great thing for them to do it. Because everybody sort of became the sort of old Christians that they wanted them to do. I'm not so sure that the world would be better. I think it would probably be worse especially in Washington Heights. [18:07]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been (inaudible) the new Hell?</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: New Washington Heights.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Washington Heights I mean. </p>

<p>PATIENT: When I first got involved in Washington Heights you know it's - it's maybe it's (inaudible) but it's - the people don't have a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what they were complaining about too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: They're complaining that nobody can make a commitment to follow through with their programs. And they have all of these different things that are going on and 20 people are supposed to show up. And three people show up. And that's what Washington Heights is. I mean everybody's fighting for a piece of everybody. And maybe that's it. Actually Washington Heights - I prefer to go some place else - actually it's much nicer in the city because (sighs) I'm going to get stopped. At least they're not after a piece of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If they want - if anybody wants more out of (inaudible). Everybody wants a bigger piece of something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're like carnivores.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Carnivores. Yeah. Like carnivores. (clears throat) Or </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Animals?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It's that if they're paying you they want more, they want more, they want more. I understand that. I would probably do the same thing if - if I were sufficient (inaudible). Well I do that with (inaudible). And then some times they don't. No, either they're intent to - if it's a small group that doesn't get bigger they become efficient because that's when they put the pressure on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Am I not being clear on anything? [20:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm really having an eerie feeling of maybe living in Washington Heights myself.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: So as I really have succeeded in bringing Washington Heights into the room.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you have in some way because I feel that I'm in a place where with you trying to tell me something but I'm not getting it fully and I'm not sure where you are. I'm not sure what's troubling you right now. And I was just about to ask you so could you describe to me how you feel right now? What is your state of mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (sighs) I don't know. My state of mind. (laughs) I'm not doing very well today. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's not only me who can't be glad.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Laughs) Maybe so. Well maybe I'm just attached. I'm not sure but maybe it's one of those attached areas when - it's maybe I - maybe I just don't have anything useful to say (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what. [22:33]</p>

<p>PATIENT: My state of mind. I think the state of mind is determined. Things are funny in a way. (Inaudible). Usually I have like all of these phone calls to make but (inaudible) some days I'm on the phone for two hours with a bunch of this and a bunch of different things and today I just. Today I managed to restrict that a little bit. I wasn't on the phone all that much. And well maybe it's because I was lack of (inaudible) again. Well that sort of tends to put me some place else perhaps. I'm not sure. (Inaudible). I've been trying to solve some problems I've been having with this stuff. Maybe you know it just - it doesn't have any connection with - it doesn't have any connection with anything I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What - what doesn't have any?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Working out stuff on the keyboard. Technical problems. Maybe I guess I get really detached from these (inaudible). So if you can imagine sitting in a room with a (inaudible) for - before hours for work. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess there are no - not many words.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It doesn't have words. No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I didn't think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean there are things but not words. I can describe the things but (laughs) who would know - who could possibility - I mean you really think it's hard to describe Washington Heights. You want me to describe something really - no. [25:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is - this is a little bit what it feels like to you that there are things but that they are hard to describe in words - difficult to describe in words. It feels like there are a lot of things but you're not - you're not - it's hard to manage how to describe it for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So and because of that it doesn't feel like - in a sense it doesn't feel to me like you're detached. It feels to me like you're - you're sense of like several things. One of them is that you're struggling to articulate something that's not easily articulated. And also that on another level that you're not sure if you want to articulate it or not because maybe something will happen to it if it gets articulated. It will lose something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you know it's kind of isn't that but (inaudible) I guess. It occurred to me that life isn't necessary to articulate them all. Because it's necessary to talk about what's going on. But it's something - whatever is going on is something that you've got to be able to articulate. And so this (inaudible) is like no context. It sort of washes out the context with its room. [26:58]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Washes out the context of its (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: The context of where I've been doesn't come into here very easily because it's all about talking about things. You know it's not all about doing these things. I'm doing okay but those - those aren't the same because the test is some distance off. (clears throat) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long (inaudible) skip a week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess whatever the thread was - was going on (sighs) (clears throat) How is it to skip a week? How is it to come every week is the other part of the question. And the - there's a sort of a thread that I guess gets picked up from week to week and usually I can remember back to whatever is going on. And what usually happens is whatever goes on sort of through (inaudible) kind of (inaudible) which I want to think about things afterwards and. And sometimes I imagine things that I might have said or things that I should probably - probably try to go into later on based on what is in. Sometimes a week later I remember them and sometimes I don't. But usually a week later I'm some place else. Two weeks later I'm definitely some place else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when this (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I got to miss a link anyway. You're always going to miss a link.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well because at the end of one time whatever is you know whatever momentum there is - is not going to - unless it's - it has an extraordinary (sighs) force to it, it's not going - it's not going to carry through seven days later. I mean in my (inaudible) probably it's going to go some place and something else will be happening by then. [30:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But would this at this time 14 days it's even a glitch more than like (inaudible) and.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe so except for the - between them. I'm not working in the office. And you know that took a lot of time and you know different things that happened. I tried to deal with these Washington Heights crazies and the Easter stuff and trying to get the plan - the program going back again. It is one of the different things for them. So you know it hit - it's more - maybe more things whatever - two weeks or about a week. But it could have all happened in the one week. And it's a lot of stuff. So it's kind of - I guess it would be easier if you know the intervals were less than - it would be easier. But they - well it probably would. I guess there would be more. It could be just more connection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What connection?</p>

<p>PATIENT: From week to week or from time to time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So even once a week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if I answered the questions. (Inaudible) to describe. But I think I tried.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I have found your answer to the questions to be somewhat round about as the - as you are generally today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's - I just realized in doing that that and when you said to me what's your state of mind right now? The first thing that pops into my mind is relative to (inaudible). And it's like everything and then the answer to the question how's it to miss two weeks? And then relative to what? And Washington Heights is relative to what. And it just occurred to me that - that there's very little context in any of these things that I can talk about that happened that I think about that I can bring into there. Because to create the context is much harder than to explain what goes on. And to create the context is - to create the context of what's going on in a whole week in a space of 45 minutes is practically impossible. And if it's a lot of context to create then I'm sort of at a loss. [33:11]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could say - it sounds a little bit like you're giving up before you're even started. It's like you're.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I spend a lot of time trying to talk about these Washington Heights crazies.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean I really did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't actually give up on that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. So maybe I'm wrong. You're not giving up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know if I'm giving up or not. I mean what the - what the immediate thing is I realize that it's really hard. I thought about this before. It's really hard to (sighs) it's really hard to create the context. And I said that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I was thinking was you were describing this. I was thinking that really you're - you're trying to create a context. You're trying to bring whatever you bring in here, you bring - you try to bring it with the web of things that it's related to. It's really impossible. It's you know you said instead of my abilities to what. And if you were trying to describe an equation there's many more variables to describe than just one variable. And they're becoming abstract now. But I guess what I'm - what I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See it's not so easy.</p>

<p>(Laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I feel - it's a strange feeling that we're in the same place but it's a place of where I think we understand some kind of misunderstanding or we're you know we're really equally disconnected or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's probably well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like we're trying to - I really thought about what really remained in my mind very sharply is that when you were talking about the way one session is linked to the other week after week after week. And then you spoke - you said that you know it's already a big challenge to tie one week to the other when there's so much that's happening in the meanwhile. </p>

<p>And then you said it's even much, much more when there's two weeks. I was thinking of cutting - you spoke about a thread - I think that's the word that you used. And I was visualizing the threads going on. And I was visualizing - like my image was that over the two weeks it got torn up or it got kind of disjointed. And we're today like two - we tried to put it back together. That was my feeling. That the thread maybe is a little off now between because we've missed one link in the chain. And we're both trying to put it back together so it goes back in the same chain. [36:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That sounds like a pretty good description. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it sound right or does it feel right to you? That's what it feels to me. It can be a different feeling to you. And I think by doing this I'm also.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you say - when you say what it feels like, it's like language, which is foreign to me. I'm not - I'm even having trouble deciding what it is that you mean when you say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know when I say that I also do another thing. I'm kind of separating the context out. And I'm saying the context that I'm talking about is the context of our meetings. And that's the context that I'm thinking of. So I guess I'm in a sense less troubled by a need to bring a lot of other context in. So I'm thinking about this meeting and this meeting and this meeting and this meeting. And when there's - and when there was one meeting missing, I'm trying - my mind is trying to put together what had happened between us when we weren't together that meeting. </p>

<p>And so when I'm describing this to you and I'm asking you how it feels to you one of the things that I'm doing is that I'm telling you kind of in the background forget about the other context. In regard to our meetings, did I describe the process in a way that makes sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Actually I think it's all about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: About what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About well now that you're saying you know it's really picking up the link again. (clears throat) It's like - that's my point. I don't know how to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How can I explain to you? What do you think your job lacks? Okay. [39:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know. It's a (sighs) I mean you sort of succeeded in making a much more immediate subject. I was talking about the stuff that was going on this week and last week. And you just sort of brought it back to right now which I guess I'm not use to doing at least not on a personal basis. I guess that's helpful. I don't deal with people very much. It's hard to describe really because I already know they're always. My other thing is I'm just trying to them as well as I can but sounds like I don't really feel like I do very well. And most of the time it's more frustrating than anything else. So I would a lots of the time to (inaudible) I sort of force me to come back. It's just unusual I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it feels part not familiar?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's familiar because I remember (laughs) what it feels like when I come here and we talk. And (inaudible) familiar but most of the time it's (inaudible). I think maybe by choice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I feel that I had to put an effort into bringing you back. [41:36]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well now that I'm back. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now that we're back we have to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the way it usually works.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's a whole - a whole other frustration to us.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's I mean I think I mentioned before it's - it doesn't seem to happen with myself. So usually when (inaudible) I forget about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you like it to happen in other places?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes and no. It's - you have to get - you have to choose your friends very carefully. Choose the people that (sighs) with whom (inaudible) very carefully. And sometimes you don't know until it's too late. (Inaudible) very pleasant.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess this is you know something to put on the table for us to think about. But I think it's important here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. Undoubtedly I'll think about it for several days. I have no idea where it will be when I come back again. (Laughs) And who knows maybe Elvis (ph) will be recognizable. Actually this is much nicer but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (inaudible). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of. I mean relative to what it's sort of natural. Not your ideal console - consulting room I dare say. [43:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Next week we'll be - most likely we'll be back in the other office. But it would look different.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's the same number so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So look for it. We'll have another adjustment. And that will be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Let's see here. </p>

<p>PATIENT: So long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right see you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye.</p>

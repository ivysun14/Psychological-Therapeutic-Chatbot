<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 15. Interview 15. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I left my cigarettes here.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes I saved them for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why didn't you smoke them? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't even smoke any. Winston is my second favorite brand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. Not your very favorite, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) Things must be pretty good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd smoke them if they were my favorites. Marlboros.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing) Yeah they're somewhat alike. Yeah. Really. Oh, God. Wasn't really that many left. (Laughs) I feel kind of slap happy. I don't know why. I guess I'm tired. Really. (Inaudible 0:00:57.7)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:00:59.4)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't have matches. Do have a match?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I have matches. There you go. Thank you. (Inaudible 0:01:10.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh Lord. The bookstores. I've spent the whole Godd**n day working on that d**n scenery. For this play that's coming off tomorrow. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Right. I remember tomorrow is going to be (Inaudible at 0:01:34.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You want to come you're welcome. It's at, let me see. It's at, there's one tomorrow afternoon about 1:30 and two on Friday. Friday morning. Friday afternoon. So if you're in the area. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's funny (Inaudible 0:01:55.9). My afternoon.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just kind of full up huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well it's-</p>

<p>CLIENT: You're really missing a big show. (Chuckles) [0:02:04.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) Did you get your playbooks?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Laughs) No. I went all the way downtown. And this woman had-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was going to say to you when you said you had to get them from the night watchman. Well that's probably what they told you. But he probably doesn't know about it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) No she had this envelope waiting for me. You know. The night watchman hands me this envelope and they're all there in this envelope. She's got them all folded up very nicely. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were they the little - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah they were the programs. They weren't playbills. They were programs. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know why? I think those, aren't programs called playbills? I think that's the name. It's like a national magazine. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. That's right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's called Playbill.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well at any rate that's what she -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, so that's probably what they thought you were talking about. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. So I said, "F**k it, I don't care." (Laughs) So a nice brick wall. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not the end of the world after all. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No it's not the end of the world after all. I mean, you know, really I don't care. What. Anyway. I'll be glad when it's over with. (Laughs) The kids are doing really unbelievably bad. Really bad. I really can't get over it. It's a couple of them were in the room, they were using my room, they had dress rehearsal and they used my room to change. And some a** kid broke my shades.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I thought, d**n. Do you know? I don't know who it was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have your own private room there at school?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My classroom. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I thought you had a room. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Laughing) My classroom. I call it my room. My classroom. Their room it should be really. But you know, my room. And they've had a couple of them broke some shades. And then someone stole-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're probably pulling them down because (Inaudible at 0:03:51.9)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. They must have been. That's right. They probably were pulling them down because they didn't want anyone to see them change. Well they pulled them down and pulled them off. (Laughs) So I don't know who did it. I'd like to find out. (Chuckling) [0:04:07.7]</p>

<p>They're selling candy for a mental health program that they were trying to set up. A community health center. And you know, this man comes down selling candy. And I thought, "How at the end of the year they're starting selling candy?" And we've got to collect the money and distribute the candy and all this crap. And it's really, it's a pain in the a**. I just figure if they would just get a donation from each parent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: When they have the whole neighborhood selling candy who is going to buy the candy? It doesn't make any sense. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is kind of, I guess the idea is that it's much easier, less work to get a donation but people just feel better about making a donation for something. You know like if they get something in exchange.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course it makes for a big hassle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah that's for sure. In fact some of the kids didn't even feel like doing it. They said, "No I don't want to." And I said, "You know well that's okay." Or their parents said no. Well I can't blame them. If your kid is going to go from door to door selling candy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:05:18.4)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had to do enough of it myself. Like going to a parochial school you're selling something everyday of the year practically. You know? With newspapers and turkey raffles. (Laughs) Oh it was really a joke. So we used to go into taverns and catch some drunk. (Chuckling) Who would buy a box of candy from you. Yeah that's how they used to make their money. </p>

<p>Oh God. I went by Tanya's last night. And you know I was discussing with her what we had said the other day about it being, at times it could become an obligation. You know stuff like that. Asking her how she would feel. You know. If she would be hurt or something like this. And she said, "Yes." She would be hurt. And but she would try to understand. I said, "Oh well at least it's better than nothing. At least you'd try to understand." [0:06:23.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she said yes she really could be hurt. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. And she could be hurt, what if you told her that you didn't want to go to bed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I didn't want to go to bed. Like if I just said, "I don't feel like going to bed." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she said yes she would be hurt. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did she say why she would be hurt? Was it that she'd take it personally like it was a reflection on herself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's too bad. Because it shouldn't be taken as a reflection on herself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And she said something about like the way I had been toward her before I started this therapy, it was kind of like an antagonistic attitude. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she says having this before and then being told you know she would feel that it would be still maybe like an attitude. An antagonistic attitude. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:07:20.9) kind of hark back to. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She'd see it somehow like you were being antagonistic to her. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. Right. Being kind of antagonistic toward her. And I said, "No." I said, "You know it really wouldn't be any, it's not like I wouldn't love you or anything else like that." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't feel antagonistic. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No no. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If anything you feel somewhat antagonistic if you feel obligated.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. But and she said that she would try to understand. You know. But, I don't know. And I said, "If you were to tell me that you didn't feel like going to bed, I don't think I'd be hurt." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. I just feel well, you know, she just doesn't want to. I don't think I would really be hurt. But I think, and then I said, it's like maybe again the old story where it's the woman's prerogative. [0:08:14.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To say, "No I don't feel like going to bed." And then the man just saying, "Oh well, okay." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She is the one that is giving or something. It says if, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. It's kind of like she's giving you something. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a very, I think that kind of attitude dates back from the days where sex was for men. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Uh-huh. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A woman was a possession. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For sex. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think it's, no it's still very prevalent. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's still, like it's still here. I believe at any rate. (Chuckles) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you really kind of feel that you just kind of, like if she's going to want to, or let me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I have to deal with this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:09:09.6) manly obligation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah right. Yeah. But I can see, I'm just going to have to say it. I just don't feel like it. And if it does hurt her, I'm sorry. But that's the way it is. If I don't feel like it then I just don't feel like it. But well. And at any rate we shall see. You know what the story is going to be. Because like I enjoy doing a lot of other things with her too. Besides going to bed. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I was surprised she said yes she would be hurt. (Chuckles) [0:10:11.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of expected her to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No well that's all right. Or I understand. Or something like that. I figured she was just being honest. But I really was, I was kind of surprised. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of expected her to just be much more accepting. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was kind of like she was accepting. She said, "Well I feel hurt but I accept it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try to understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah. Uh-huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you didn't expect her to feel hurt.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:10:43.0) maybe I'm a little disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Just like right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right. (Laughs) But at any rate. Then I said, like you had said, we're both kind of fairly new at the game. And you have to become adjusted to it and stuff like that. And she agreed to that. So. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did that kind of conversation kind of leave you feeling pretty unsettled?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like (Inaudible at 0:11:23.9) settled.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. In fact it left me feeling kind of well. I was really kind of apprehensive about even saying it. So like when after I said it I felt kind of good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like at least I said it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was really kind of, it really was-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On your mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was really on my mind. And I just really wasn't, know how I was going to go about saying it. But after I said it, it was kind of like it was over with and it was kind of a relief. (Laughs) But maybe it should've.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it should've?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like her saying, "Yes it would upset me." Maybe it should've upset me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know that she had said this. [0:12:09.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't sound like a terrible (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it didn't. It really didn't. Right. It really didn't. And I just said, "Well if it does. It does." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it just kind of felt good to kind of, like that was something you were really going through inside. Feeling upset when you felt compelled to do it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have intercourse and feeling lousy about that. Kind of you were saying it like it was for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah right. Yeah. She really had no other choice. Really. (Laughs) Certainly if I don't feel like having intercourse I'm not going to be able to have intercourse. So. (Laughs) That's the whole thing. But at any rate it was said. Did you ever use any other method besides the [Rogerian]? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No? I would be interested, like if you were to say to me what you really thought of me. Just from your point of view.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then like I said to myself, "Well who knows someone better than himself?" (Laughs) You know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who knows someone better than himself? [0:14:09.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I guess that's really, that's pretty much at the heart of things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it really is. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:14:13.8) Well I can help you and try to focus what you're saying more, but you're the, if I interpret what you're saying through some things in theory; well that you might believe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not necessarily true. You are the person who knows the best. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But I was just curious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Were you kind of wondering there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I was looking for, if you were going to say well, I thought, "Well if he criticized me, how would I take that?" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. You were kind of wondering if I was feeling kind of any kind of critical thoughts inside that I haven't said.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. If you observe something more about me that I wasn't aware of. And if you were to say to me, like if you were to say to me, "Oh you're rotten." Or something like this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was interested to think how I would take it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I would just-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:15:09.4) put you down.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. If you were to put me down. And I would kind of, if it would really bother me. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if it would bother me, I think if you said something, if it would really bother me then I'd probably do something to correct it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because again like I said that's the type of a person I am. Where if someone says something to me, or gives me a push-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It bothers you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:15:35.8)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Uh-huh. Then I try to-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess I haven't said-in terms of saying bad things, (Inaudible at 0:15:47.1). One they do no good. Second of all they just don't feel good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think I've said things to you about, well it's not like saying, "You should do this." But kind of like I have said to you, "You're worrying about it." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's going to make it worse. (Inaudible at 0:16:08.7)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you can try and relax. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like I have given you, which I guess strict Rogerians probably don't do. [0:16:16.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. That's true. I think it's better. Like if someone were to just criticize someone or something, they found something really wrong with them, if they really tell them about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like this man who I work for. He's such a a**. If he finds, he's the type that if you really-he wouldn't come up and tell you. If you heard it, you heard it second or third hand. Like, oh that bas***d. But I think if he would, you just really wouldn't feel -  like you'd probably go about trying to correct yourself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really resent that. Where they keep everything so hush hush. And secretive. And stuff like that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. Well I do remember when you said some things that I really felt were, could you lead you into trouble-like when you were saying, "Well it was before you had slept with Tanya." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: First time failed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That would be the test and I'd feel awful. And I told you. It did happen. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I just really felt that that was just plain silly. Something that could easily be done but it would be a mistake to do it. To feel lousy and that's the ultimate test. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember telling you that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. Right. That's why I think that's really basically a number of people's problems. No one comes up and says anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kind of like you don't know what people are (Inaudible at 0:17:51.0). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How people would react. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Really. That's the truth. It's like they're supposed to know whether they're supposed to be holding a summer school at the school. Where I teach at. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And this man hasn't said nothing to nobody. Except his few little close clique. Oh my God. The school is black. So we have, we refer to it as the people who are he gets along with in his little clique, they're the house ni**ers, and the rest of us are field ni**ers. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) The field ni**ers haven't been asked to teach summer school. (Laughs) And we have-[0:18:34.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The house ni**ers are black. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah right. Everybody's black. Except me. (Laughs) But I'm still like a field ni**er. And the field ni**ers aren't, they're not asked to work for the summer. Which is really kind of lousy. But that's the game he plays. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're the only white teacher in the school? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No one other. Me and another woman. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow. Has that been hard? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It's beautiful. Like it's been really nice. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I guess you're a younger age. Like with high school they might have more resentment or something because of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They would. Yeah they would. Yeah really. Well I think even the teachers just getting along; I just get along with most of them beautifully. They're really a great group of people. It's really interesting. (Chuckles) We always have a good time. (Laughs) My parents find it, just go (Inaudible at 0:19:44.4).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And the people say, "My God! You're crazy!" </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're in a jungle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. What are you doing there? And it's really nice. (Laughing) I really like it. "Oh you go into that neighborhood everyday?" (Laughs) Oh it's really a kick. It really is. It's so funny. I said, "Yes everyday." Then my Mother throws out unsubtle hints every once in awhile. "Are you planning on staying?" (Laughs) [0:20:20.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I can see that with some neighborhoods. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's black but it's not (Inaudible at 0:20:31.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: No really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of almost, there's some middle class (Inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. That's the truth. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Black. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the middle classy black. The mink ghetto it's referred to. (Laughs) That's what it's called. And we have a white principal of course too. Not for long I hope. But the house ni**ers, the field ni**ers always have a good time. But that really kind of bugged me. Yesterday was kind of like there were a lot of things. The fact (Inaudible at 0:21:19.2) the summer school program. There's one teacher in the school who's an adjustment teacher. And she's really a nice looking woman. And she sits there all day and does nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just nothing. Absolutely nothing. And you're in there working your a** off. And she comes by, comes out at three fifteen looking like she just walked in. We're just dragging out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No one needs adjusting or?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh she's really something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She has no work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She has no work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I could give her plenty of work to do. If she was looking for work, just come around. But she just knows how to deal with men. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's what she does. Which really bugs the hell out of ya. Like yesterday, I kind of resented the fact that we had to sell the candy. [0:22:18.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really thought that, like I'm tired of doing other jobs. I just wasn't trained to sell candy. You know what I mean? I'm not a candy salesman. So please don't ask me to sell candy. I just can't buy it. I don't care if it's for-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:22:36.0) can't buy it, you don't want to sell it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't want to sell it. I can't buy it. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And collecting money and just getting all this candy straight and crap and-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like being a fundraiser.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right! Yeah! </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And coordinating fundraising.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. So I was walking out the door and this adjustment teacher who doesn't do sh*t says to me, "Oh Connor. Would you like to buy a box of candy?" And I said, "Don't start Kathleen. Just don't start." (Laughs) Because I knew if I would have said something to her-I just had to keep on going. If I would have said something to her it really would've been rotten. (Chuckles) Because she doesn't have to sell any candy. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I do. It just really teed me off to no end. I mean if I have any really pressing psychological problems I'll (Inaudible at 0:23:43.4). (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't. There really isn't anything that I really feel depressed about today. I was thinking about worrying. And I thought, if nobody did worry, no one would get anything done. But it sure would be a hell of a nice place to live. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Any, like in the world. If no one worried about what they were going to do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh I see what you mean. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It really would be a hell of a world. But it would really be kind of a nice place to live. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It would just kind of be very relaxed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess if, like I guess the thing about worrying maybe is like finding some kind of -  well, if you have to worry to get things done maybe you can do a minimum amount of worrying and just-[0:24:38.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I mean there's so many other places. Well even within this country, they say in the South they just go along. And they're really-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Much slower. And relaxed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah much slower. Relaxed pace. Which is really maybe what I need. (Laughing) Of course then I'd probably go out of my mind. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes that's very true of country folk too usually.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh Tanya says the Bahamas is unbelievable. They just go along. You go into a restaurant and it takes you about a half hour for a cup of coffee. And no one really is concerned about it. If you get it, okay. If you don't, well that's okay too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:25:36.2)</p>

<p>CLIENT: They probably would enjoy life a hell of a lot more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah they're supposedly very happy people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I think that the thing is that everyone, I mean within the city and stuff -  I don't know if it's a sense of responsibility or a sense of getting money. I just think that a sense of responsibility is instilled in you when you're living within a city all your life. Where you have to do this. And you have to do that. And you have to do this. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you have to be here at a certain time. And you have to be there at a certain time. And it's just if you're not, well you're in trouble. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. [0:26:21.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can understand people -  I'd be pissed if someone, like if someone wasn't going to be there or something. I would be rather upset. I was talking to Ana downstairs and she said something about they're starting a thing at the Central Park Bank. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's this?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See it's partly because of budget reasons that the council (Inaudible at 0:27:21.6). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: End of June. It's run by the University.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So with the number of people who are here, you know working here now and doing, we're starting a private kind of thing that's not affiliated with University. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We'll be doing the same kinds of things just not under the, I don't know what to call it, not under the-</p>

<p>CLIENT: The auspicious eye. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That was the phrase coming to my mind. (Inaudible at 0:27:52.5) It'll be the same kind of thing. It just won't be part of the University of Chicago. It'll be made up of number of the people who (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. That sounds good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well yeah. It sounds like a good thing because it's, well when people need help-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's nice that there's a place. Like there are people do it privately, they're often very expensive. [0:28:22.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Especially like if you down to these on Park Avenue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The psychiatrists. And good things. Good things do get done here. So like I think there really is a need for a place like this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With the fact that it's outside the University doesn't really make a difference in terms of helping people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. But they're going to use the basic set up also? I think, what is it? There's one South. The NY City Bank or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think, I don't know if it's all group counseling or just-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it'll be, I don't know much yet. Since I'm leaving.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it'll be individual therapy. I mean there won't be as many offices because it just would be-you know they're renting a suite. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like the bank building is real big. But there's suites and offices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I imagine it will be group therapy because there are quite a number of people here who like to do group therapy. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And are very involved in it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you know I think it will be pretty much the same. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:29:32.8) Different building. Not under the budget controls (Inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: What are they going to use for a budget?</p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: Well I think the idea is in the beginning until it gets self sustaining the people on the staff won't take money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then when it gets, after awhile, I think it will be a non profit. In other words, they'll try to run it from the fees that they take in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think they may charge a stipend. It will still be the same kind of (Inaudible at 0:29:59.0) according to people's  - . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Salary. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They will be paid. But I don't know. It will be just be a little bit larger. Each salary. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because some people who really make nothing get to pay almost nothing. I think five dollars is the minimum fee here. (Inaudible at 0:30:18.4)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I've heard. Well it's a good idea at any rate. [0:30:32.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope it works out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope so too. (Inaudible at 0:30:38.8) applying to this place. (Inaudible) there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they're getting - . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm. Is that the big one? It's an old building? I'm trying-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it's, do you know where the Central Park Theater is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. It's right on the corner. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's on that corner. (Inaudible at 0:31:00.9) That thing that flashes the temperature. That's how I - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. Yeah. Have they even got any funds as far as the government is concerned?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know. I they're applying for some state funds. (Inaudible at 0:31:17.5) Some funds look like they're very promising. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. Well it's the University itself that is closing this place down. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean they were the ones-they probably did have the money they just didn't want to - .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well money is pretty tight these days. Because of the war. Like the University. I'm sure more than half of the money that the University operates on is not from students. That makes up like (Inaudible at 0:31:50.0) percent. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Really. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's from grants from the government to do research. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Professors' salaries get paid out of that. Secretaries. And because of the war a lot of those, you know, aid to education, at least to higher education - I don't know if elementary is really being cut back-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there is a shortage of money in the University.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that there are other reasons other than money. This place is supposed to be doing a lot of research and it doesn't do a whole lot of research.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's supposed to be performing an academic function as well as-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. They've gotten enough money to build a building next door they should have enough. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's weird like that got built, the Shah of Iran gave money for that building. Oh no that's for another building that's planned over there. I don't know who gave money for this one. Whoever it's named after. It's some name. That's how they build buildings. [0:32:45.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And people are much more likely to donate, like the guy who gives the biggest money gets the building named after him. Alright. So people are much more likely to give money so they can have a building named after them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Building named after them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Than to give money so a place can stay around or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like when, the medical school has been here forever. And all of a sudden this guy gave many millions of dollars. (Inaudible at 0:33:07.3) got renamed (Inaudible) School of Medicine after him. See what I mean. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: When you're thinking about it, they all have. I just think it's the buildings. And-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Like this building has three different names depending on which end you're in. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Three (Inaudible at 0:33:31.3) to one stone. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Who cares? I mean who really cares? If a building is named after you or not. If you're a dead person, they come around (Inaudible at 0:33:46.1). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well (Inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: They put up a nice little piece of sculpture outside of the building. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (Inaudible at 0:33:58.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know what it's supposed to signify. (Inaudible) Weird.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was pretty weird when I saw it yesterday too. (Inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It really is. Isn't it for international studies?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think it's like people in Anthropology or people (Inaudible at 0:34:26.1) countries (Inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm still interested in what happens to all these studies and all this research. I just wouldn't even know what happens to it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It gets published in journals.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that's it. Journals and books and that's it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:34:43.3)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That get stuck on the shelves. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) boxes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. In some of these boxes. And it doesn't really seem to do a hell of a lot of good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really doesn't. When you think about the thousands and thousands and millions and millions of dollars that are spent on research. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess some of it has practical applications.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot it just I guess is just for knowledge sake. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Right. I think there ought to be a little more practicality in the whole business. I think it has a note of prestige about the whole thing. Which a lot of people look for. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah. This kind of image of a scholar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. And you know the whole country wants to maintain this thing. And it's really sad. There just isn't enough. I mean if you aren't a scholar you're fine. But there is a hell of a lot more people than there are scholars. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. [0:35:58.7] </p>

<p>CLIENT: This morning I really would've liked Tanya-I really had an urge to have sex. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it really would've been nice if Tanya were here. And then I thought, "Oh, you know, well I'll see her later on this week." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm thinking, "Oh Christ. What's going to happen when she's going to be gone all summer?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like wow. (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:37:19.6) know what to do right then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know I can do it. But the person I do it with-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I thought I would just, if she's going to be pissed off (Inaudible at 0:37:31.0). Just go out and find some girl. Start taking other girls out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you (Inaudible) that you'd like to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I would. Then I thought-because I wouldn't want to fall back into the homosexual activity stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. (Inaudible at 0:37:53.0)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Which would be the easiest way out. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. [0:37:54.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just said, "No." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well she can just-if she knew about it she could just-what's the difference? She could feel jealous of a man. I mean you're not going to tell her about it but the point - you see what I mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well. It's like if she's going to feel bad and get pissed off that you're having sex with someone-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - would it make any difference to her. Of course it would make a difference in other ways if it were a man.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. To me, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But why she would be pissed off about it if were a man too. Because you're having sex with someone (Inaudible at 0:38:29.6).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah that's true. She'd probably be pissed off about it more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well she could be upset about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Really. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you kind of really feel like you just want to-</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not going to sit around all summer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Sit around. And you don't want to kind of be forced into seeing men. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Having sex with men.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you'd really like to find some girls and go out with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe even sleep with them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that feel scary to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:38:59.4)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true too. I never really-no it doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I remember when we would talk in the beginnings like where do you find a girl. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seemed like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. No it doesn't. It really doesn't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or how do you talk-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Because I don't think it would really bother me. Like the thing is if I said something to a girl. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if she said like go to hell or something like this or just immediate shut down, shot down; I don't think it would really bother me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You don't feel like you have as much at stake. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Really. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like I know I've been accepted. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like well she didn't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Really.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it might've been nice but it's not the end of the world. (Inaudible at 0:39:46.4)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Truthfully. Truthfully. Yeah. I guess I just won't say anything to her about intentions of taking out other women while she's gone to Spain. I thought it was rather selfish on her part anyway. (Chuckles) [0:40:10.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like-</p>

<p>CLIENT: She leaves the country what am I supposed to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:40:09.8) country as if you're supposed to be kind of sealed up in a box.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She just wraps you up and says, "Now stay there." </p>

<p>CLIENT: Stay there and don't go anywhere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stay where you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Really which is kind of impossible if you ask me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know like, "I'm going off. I'm your life." (Inaudible at 0:40:31.5)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But she would probably-I don't know. They say women always do wait and all this stuff. Of course they don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some do. Some don't. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like men. (Laughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Some do. Some don't. But I don't know what her-if she does. She probably wouldn't say anything to be about it. So I wouldn't be concerned about if I didn't know anything about it. I'm not going to be worried about it. (Chuckles) I'm thinking about all the old college girls and if they're all married. (Laughs) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:41:25.6)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Who's left? (Laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I kind of sense like it feels like that world is open to you. Like in college it didn't feel so open. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of well I missed some opportunities. I wonder if any of them are still around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Really. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:41:40.9) can still be opportunities. Are you kind of-I guess in a way you kind of, you'd rather Tanya didn't go but you don't feel overwhelmed. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No I don't. In fact I think it may be kind of interesting to see what happens as far as I'm concerned. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's (Inaudible at 0:42:23.8) kind of an opportunity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can go out with girls. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Presents a whole new outlook. (Laughs) Really. [0:42:30.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like I could've done that years ago but I couldn't because of the way I felt. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which now I feel like I can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. There was a man in school who was an exterminator. And he was exterminating all around and all this stuff. And I guess he was supposed-all the women thought he was really good looking. And they were just carrying on and so and all this stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was talking to this woman I work with, Kathleen-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's the one? The nice looking one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah she's, well she's nice looking yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean the adjustment. She - -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no no no. No no no. This is another - Kathleen. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she said-you know they were talking about it and he had talked to her. And he had noticed the whole teachers-we're all putting on this play like together. And he said that he had written some plays. And that he was a bachelor. And he was really interested in getting married. And he was even interested in getting married to someone who already had a family and all this stuff. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they were talking about it. And they said, "Well either, number one he's lying." "Or he's", as they termed, "a little funny." And I thought to myself, "Is that really true?" Like that's the first thing they say if a man is like over 30.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if he's anything halfway decent. Or if he's supposed to be looking so good. If he's anything over 30 they think something's really wrong with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean the fact that he isn't married?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah the fact that he isn't married. You know something is really wrong with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm. Must be funny. Maybe he wants someone just for the family because (inaudible at 0:44:16.4). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like people's minds are already suspecting. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I just thought to myself it's possible. But I don't-maybe it isn't true. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:44:31.1) might be true that he wants to get married but he never met anyone he really (Inaudible). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [0:44:36.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some people really want to have certain standards or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And they don't meet the person who meets them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But they just felt that like everybody should be married. (Chuckling) In fact this one woman said to me, "What are you doing? How do you (inaudible at 0:44:53.7)? How are you still able to be single? Why haven't you been caught?" As the old saying goes. What are you still doing around? (Chuckling) Free. (Laughs) And said, "Like now I'm really getting-I really enjoy it." And I really do now. Because it's really kind of nice. In fact I'm thinking there really isn't-well as far as marriage is concerned the only thing that I'm missing now would be the fact that if you really wanted someone to be there. They wouldn't be there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But as far as anything else is concerned companionship would be the only thing that would be missing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is important. But I was thinking to myself if I would really want to be with someone or not be with someone. Like if I would want to be alone more often than I would like to be with someone. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I was thinking as far as my day is concerned I'm really with someone most of the day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But as far as the rest is concerned I don't know. Weekends would be the only problem that would really bother me. Would be the only time that it really would bother me. Would be weekends. Because the weekdays just the job and everything about it you're always doing something. But weekends I think would be the only time it would really bother me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your time's up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: This is Session 11. Session 11.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Today has been really fun I took a new job. When I was at work I was not liking work at all. I've been expecting my period all week and then it hasn't come, and Murphy is (inaudible) is really starting to grate on my nerves about it. Every two hours – ‘Have you had your period come.' And it started to irritate me very, very much. And …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is the thing? That he keeps on simply the water dripping effect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And also what I'll say if it doesn't come and I have to have a fight about whether you have an abortion, which is the type of question I just don't need at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's like the clouds are gathering every time he asks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I know for a fact that I'm going to do it pretty much if three weeks from now I don't have my period. And I'm damn positive I'm going to have an abortion, there is no doubt in my mind. I just wish he would stop hassling me about it, and hassling himself about it. My periods is either going to come or it is not, I'm either going to be pregnant or not, whether my period comes or not.</p>

<p>It is something physical, it is nothing we're talking about. He can't have anything to do with it. The more he harps on it the more nervous I become which is ridiculous. My period don't come three weeks late. So I wish he would just drop it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So kind of like, if you weren't doing this you wouldn't be nervous and you wouldn't be particularly worried, and if you were pregnant or not it would be a matter of fact and you'd do what you'd do in either case.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or at least that is what I would try and do, I'd rather not get hyper about it at the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're getting pretty mad at him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm just really not feeling (inaudible) with him at the moment which is really strange because we had our best day yesterday. We really liked being together and everything was fine. But I go through these strange trips every now and then…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So would be that to say that yesterday during the day …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yesterday during the day was fine. When I go through these strange trips off and on where I really don't like sex, I don't like intercourse, I just don't enjoy it, I just don't have any use for it, and I feel it is a real imposition on me emotionally and I just don't like it and I just want to be left alone.</p>

<p>But it is really strange because I really don't mind, kind of sexual play, that is fine, but I really don't want screwing. I just don't get anything out of it, it is very unpleasant. And I've been feeling that way the past couple of days. And I've been deliberately kind of lying to him about how I feel because it gets to be such a hassle when I don't feel like making love and he's usually be horny. And he gets into all these guilt trips and I get into all these guilt trips, and we (inaudible) with one another.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that when you tell him the truth that you just don't, aren't into sex that that is what happens?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah he gets very uptight. It becomes very tense to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean having to lie like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And last night – I mean it gets to be this big production that I really hate. Like the first thing he starts talking about in the morning is that we'll have sex at night, and I really don't care. And I certainly don't want to spend the whole day talking about looking forward to it, especially when I don't want to have it at all.</p>

<p>And yesterday was just one of those days when he kind of set the day sexually, figuratively licking his chops. And it is just too much of a hassle to tell him, no I don't really feel like that. Especially after a really nice day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand how it is too much of a hassle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it gets to be this big trip about how he's not a good lover and I'm not interested in him anymore, and I'm going to leave him, and what is he doing wrong…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what do you think about all that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of bored.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't need to think if he's right or wrong, but it is more just a drag. Like kind of a routine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is kind of a routine we go through that doesn't get through to what's bothering me, which I really have no idea what is happening. And I just know that this is where I am just completely cold. I'm just totally turned off. And I'm fine as long as it is kind of affectionate contact, but I just don't like sexual contact. It is just nothing, absolutely no response at all. Every response I make is totally manipulated.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this a general thing? I didn't…</p>

<p>CLIENT: It kind of comes and goes, and it's been bugging me for about a half year or more. Since we started living together really is, permanently. And also it started, actually it started much before that. It is really like an outgrowth of my bladder infection when sex used to be painful all the time and I just didn't like it. I didn't want to be hurt. And now that I've stopped hurting I'm just not feeling that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you meaning that it is kind of a conditioning thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Possibly. I don't know, maybe that is it. I'm not sure at all. It is almost as if our sexualities are on a really different level. Kind of that I'm totally good to go without sex for a week or so, then to really like it and really want it and really dig it, be really intense and it's really long. And that's it, I'm fine for another week or two. But with Murphy it is constant.</p>

<p>I don't know that is how I feel, I can't tell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I don't know is that that is kind of an explanation just different levels, the way that is kind of an outcome. I mean… well I'll tell you one thing, I don't want to talk anymore about it today, but I want to (inaudible).</p>

<p>Think about what people know about it too and how to treat it. So I just want to say that in parentheses.</p>

<p>But it is kind of like you don't want sex very often, and it seems like lately not now, or at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Very often I just don't want it very much, whereas Murphy does.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now it isn't clear to me what the problems that create that seem to have a lot to do with you aren't willing to tell him that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, because he gets really hung up about it. It is not just, it is kind of there is a (inaudible) demanding me to have sex. But it would be fine if I wanted to have sex (inaudible) but I don't. And I feel really badly about it. I feel really fucked up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like there is something wrong with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what is it that you kind of feel is wrong with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess most of the time I'm afraid of being mostly frigid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want to please him and just have sex.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What would that mean to you if that was true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well what it does mean now, is that I use my body for (inaudible) and I didn't like him for having sex when I don't want it. It is very upsetting. I feel just completely phony. Absolutely no personal honesty and no personal integrity whatsoever. And like last night…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so it's kind of very basic kind of love.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To me it's not basic as a (inaudible). I'm lying, I'm not even intellectually lying, physically lying. I'm just in no truth whatsoever when I do it, especially last night. And I hate it, I really hate it so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want him to leave me alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean kind of a feeling like he was making you go through with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And I wanted him to come and he just wasn't coming and I was just really mad and so awful and I wouldn't want him to see my face because I was going through total contortions. I wanted to hit him I just wanted to push him off me and out me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he was imposing just on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. All that demanding. He was kind of drunk, he had been with Don so … and kind of demanding. And I was giving assurance that I loved him and I would stay with him and I found him attractive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And all you're feeling is kind of disgust.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just didn't want any part of it, so I kind of faked my way through it and then said that I was hurting so I couldn't stand to have him. And he fell off to sleep like right away. So I just kind of (inaudible). really be attracted to and never made it.</p>

<p>And he's really upset this morning that I was totally phony this morning with him, but I didn't tell him what was happening. Because he takes it on a totally personal level that I'm not attracted to him. And I really do think that I'm not attractive. And a lot of it has to do with what I feel about myself physically at the moment. I'm feeling very heavy, I'm feeling very bloated, I'm feeling very fat and I'm feeling stupid. And I still haven't finished my paper and I haven't started my paper, and he's started to make impossible demands on my time again. Like making trips, and I just don't feel good about myself. I also wish my period would come but I really do get pre-period blues, and bloating and shit like that (inaudible)</p>

<p>So I don't want to hassle with it, because he's going to go through – what am I doing wrong, oh my god, I'm not being good enough for you, why am I not attractive to you. Urgh. He's totally missing the point, that is not what is bothering me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you've got a sort of complicated situation. It seems like it goes something like this; one you're having, in addition you talked quite a bit just (inaudible) and it seems like you're okay and you are taking him. And yet you're feeling like you can't tell him this because of what he'll do, because it will be too much hassle. And yet to avoid trouble with him you are putting yourself in a position where you hate yourself even more because on top of everything else you're being a hypocrite.</p>

<p>And I guess, well I can't … just saying in general that thinking about it is what kind of lengths you can go to, to avoid these hassles with him, which you can kind of predict and which you can sense they are already there whether they are out front or not. It seems like you're doing an awful lot to avoid those. And (inaudible)</p>

<p>And I guess I don't know. Is that really the kind that you want to talk about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well when he says (inaudible). And I get between sulking around and having to have an (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But isn't that like saying that there is no imagination you have for an alternative, that it can never be anything but this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I kind of felt this way before digging him (inaudible) and sitting here thrashing it out has just not done anything to it except made me feel awful about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come? I mean you feel worse then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Feel that I was holding back from Murphy, or that I was hurting him. Or I was kind of physically inconveniencing him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that is hard because you are physically, sometimes both because in the sense that between (inaudible) means and then it is not a question of whether or not you've got the (inaudible) but what are your priorities and what are you willing to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The whole thing then gets wrapped up in the hassle of he is looking for a job right now, he's feeling very insecure I know, and saying that he's going to need a lot of help and support. I think he's feeling that I'm not giving it to him. I don't know if I am or not, but I think that at times I do (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So sometimes you are coming through for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And the rest of the times I'm not and I just feel kind of guilty. And that is kind of caught up in the sexual thing. It is just another thing where I just feel guilty.</p>

<p>I don't know I just feel like I really fucked up somehow. I just haven't finished anything, nothing. There is nothing I've completed. I haven't finished any of my papers, and I haven't finished any of the projects around the house. I want to paint the back porch and I want to make curtains for the front room because you can see into the apartment from two block away, literally. And there is all this shit. And there are all these things I really want to do, and I'm just not getting it together and I'm meeting resistance from him all the way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean not getting it together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well like getting it together would be sitting down and writing something major, just getting it off my chest, study the next three days and then starting my research and really getting it together. Reading enough so I can go downstairs and go to the lab next week. And there is some things that I was going to do some songs, and I've been going to the rehearsals twice a week. Saturday afternoon, Tuesday. I want to take (inaudible) which would be an hour or two hours in one evening. And I was supposed to take yoga which was supposed to be in the afternoon on Tuesday evenings right after mass. And I will be working the lounge for a couple of hours every day.</p>

<p>And I'm just getting this major feedback from Murphy that I'm neglecting him, and that there is no time for us to be together. The only time he has with me is Saturday nights and Wednesday nights, and there is no evenings free for me to be with him, doing what we should do together. And he'll never see me, and he'll see me even less than he did during school year. And he doesn't want to put any pressure on me to drop the drama but it's up to me. And weaving has been cut out some other nights, and what are you going to do about your rehearsals. That will be worse than that, I'll never see you, we'll never go out.</p>

<p>And I feel like crap, that I'm not giving him enough time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess it is just the same kind of crap.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I really find a lot of crap. I find that I know that couples do spend a lot of time together. They do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you find that it is not just a issue of time, it is the subject matter of the thing that could happen. The subject matter.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That is just constant demands where he is just saying, reassure me, support me, hold me up – which is coming from – I don't have a job and I'm afraid I'm not going to get a job and we're going to run out of money.</p>

<p>Well I'm finally having issues where he's just not doing anything to get a job or anything. He's just not. He's written four letters and he's made three phone calls and he hasn't gotten off his ass. And he sits and has long talks with me about why he can't get off his ass, and how it troubles him and how his big problem has always been procrastination and how he needs a shrink. And I'm sick of it. I'm really, really tired of it. Like he's just saying he looking at options since he lost the playboy job ended in March. And any time I get upset about time he goes into this big song and dance how he wishes he had a job so I didn't have to work. And I've been listening to that for three months, and I didn't resent it before but it is really starting to make me mad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you simply think it's bullshit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Just think it is a ton of bullshit. And I don't mind working, I just wish he would stop laying these trips on me about my working, and how it takes time away from him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you mean that he should stop complaining, or else change his situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when he doesn't do either where are you left. I mean besides… definitely you are left angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I am left cutting back my activities because he has nothing to do with himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you think you have to make that accommodation when you've also said that he is kind of bullshitting and not really doing what he should do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well because he'll be incredibly miserable, and so will I if I just go off every night and desert him. And I'll feel guilty and he'll feel bad and won't know what to do with himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know you'll feel bad, but why would you feel guilty?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I'm not spending enough time with him, by his definition.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you are also saying that you think that his definition is shit. And then you think that he wouldn't have this problem if he went and didn't do this kind of thing. So I'm asking, does it make sense to you to conceive of your guilt as the problem instead of this thing that you should try to move with? Or can you think about that for a minute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, except that if I were to not feel guilty about doing what I want to do and just picking up and to a point doing what I want, I would still have to cope with him complaining constantly that he never seeing me. Mopping around the house looking like I've hit him, that I'm not spending enough time with him. That I haven't apportioned my ten minutes of conversation for (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay so he will bitch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He will bitch constantly, he will bitch.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that will be an unpleasant thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yet on the other hand what you do to avoid that unpleasant thing is quite an extensive amount of sulking out yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The worst thing that happened, I was at work, I was (inaudible), and Murphy called around 9 o'clock and said he was over at some friends house and they were all going down to Stephen's. And I'd never been to Stephen's and I really wanted to go to Stephen's and I let him have it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For?</p>

<p>CLIENT: For – I am kind of sure – I guess in the end because I was still there working and he was running around. And it happens all the time because I work on choice evenings where it would be nice to go Stephen's or to this movie, or over to see these friends. So I get really pissed. I was just yelling at him; that's really nice of you to call and tell me what a good time you're having while I'm working. I really appreciate that. Why don't you go over to Stephen's and stop bothering me.</p>

<p>So it is fine if he calls to tell me that he wouldn't be home when I got home and I shouldn't worry, which is perfectly valid, but I was truly nasty. I totally ruined his evening. I really felt badly. I was just really pissed. I was just really sick of hearing all the nice things he did while I was working. It was getting to be really mean.</p>

<p>And then when I'm not working, when I have some time of my own to be told that I don't spend enough time with him because he spent all his time. He's done all the things he wants to do that I don't do with him. And he's done a number of the things that I want to do with him. So he's kind of sitting around waiting for me because he's done everything he can. Well I'm really sick of this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm just trying to think of defining the problem more specifically, whether anything can move or not. One things you said is you happen to work on a choice nights when you could be doing things together. Now how did that happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no that is just money issue. I make between 80 and 100 dollars a week (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And in between there is not that much money.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And we need it right now. At the end of June we just stop getting money, and that is just. He got 400 a month from his parents and they always did, and then it stopped. And we would put it with my money and we'd have enough to pay the rent. But we'll be living every week on my money. (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is that adding, with his not working, is additional pressure on you to do that. Fill the other shoe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was wondering if I should pick up more time. And I don't want to, I really hate it, but I don't know for sure (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that is all on the notion that he's not going to get a job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, I don't know it's really hard to tell. It is very unlikely that he'll get a job which means for another month or two he won't have a job, unless he decides he's going to get one and starts looking (inaudible). But it is kind of interesting because he bitches a little bit about we can't spend time because I'm working, but all the bitching about not spending time is aimed at the things I want to do, not at the time I spend working which I don't want to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you say that again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: When he bitches about my not spending time with him…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, he doesn't complain – oh you work three nights a week and I should do something and get a job so you don't have to do that. What he counts as movable or changeable are the things that you are able to change.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are the things that I really want to do. Yeah he says, ‘I'll have to get a job so you don't have to work', but he's not doing that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess he sees that as a suggestion.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes as a suggestion, that is the guilt trip he's into. And I can't get him out of that guilt trip. There is just no way that I can reassure him that I'm loving working and not bothering to get a job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well would you want to do that anyway? I mean reassure him that way,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that it would be such a transplant lie it wouldn't work. No I wouldn't and the only reason, if he were to get a job a really well paying job, I would probably keep my job for the summer and either get something less pressure or drop most of my hours because I don't want to live on him (inaudible), but I don't have to keep this job, I could get an on-campus library job.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what about a not-well-paying job?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well if he had a job that was bringing in money I could get a non-well-paying job that I wouldn't mind doing as much. The reason I'm in this job is because I do make 90 dollars an evening so, yeah I'd love to just walk in and quite my job. You know, just wait until something else turns up. But I can't, because we're living off my money.</p>

<p>I just really feel time pressure and (inaudible) about last summer which was really exciting. (inaudible)</p>

<p>Because I don't want to feel that if I fuck around too much longer I'm like trying to do all the side-hobbyish type things like weaving and dance and music. I will hit a point where I will be concentrating, I'll really be stuck doing lab work constantly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you don't really want to get to that point?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't want to right now. I mean there are other things I want to do. And I don't want to be a 40 year old housewife taking pottery and then say, ‘Ahh.'</p>

<p>There are all these things that I want to do and I want to do them now so I can do them and have the skills when I graduate. And I think if I can't do them in the next couple of years then I'm just not going to do them until I'm 40 or something crappy like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is kind of a feeling of wanting to develop yourself and wanting to do that now, and feeling like also a very pressured thing on that, like it is just slipping away. Like it is going to be this long term kind of … where you won't have that option.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I'm afraid of I guess is that I will get so specialized and so caught up in the field that I go into which will probably be psychology or reproduction or something like that, that I won't have time to learn the things that I want to do. But if I learn them now, I have them. They will be something which I can do even though I am caught up in my lab work and therapy and whatever. I could do it. Because I really want a good career, I want to spend time on this, and I know that in five years I'm just not going to be able to take time to do beginning weaving class. But if I have a loom set up in my study room or whatever, in the den, in the living room for me to sit down and relax at I'll do it.</p>

<p>And when it's handed up to me, if I don't do it now I just have a fear I'm just never going to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well there is a couple of things. There is the whole issue of the time pressure coming now and (inaudible). But there is another thing that (inaudible) to the future and whether that connection is what you're making it sound.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it isn't. I mean it isn't but I have the time now, I want to do it now. I look at college …</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it is not really the future slipping away?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I have that feeling, I kind of have that on an emotional level. That I'm insane I've been talking about doing this for years. I've been talking about weaving for like five years and not getting it together, and now I have this chance. A nice place, I can do it in my house, it is not very expensive (inaudible). And my body is really depressed and I'm really looking forward to taking ballet again, and really cannot get back into shape.</p>

<p>I've pretty much decided to give up the drama because it is really time-consuming now and it is going to be much more time-consuming when I have much less time during the year. And I'm not, I don't think my life revolves around (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but is it kind of a summer of finally you did get it together and get organized and you're behavior in your life it is just starting to be so, and someone else is holding you back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We're just not looking at things in the same way. I mean of course he's looking for a job and I'm looking to try and develop myself. He wants to spend all his time in gathering things there is plenty to do that will (inaudible). And he knows what he wants to do, he wants to do movies and that's it, that is his big interest. That is all. And it is…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so is it that maybe he doesn't understand your personal things right now, or that he is not into the same kind of things that you're…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really know if he understands my approach to things or not. I think he thinks I'm kind of flittering my time away, but if it's something I will do if it will make me feel better. I don't know whether he thinks that or not, I really don't know we don't talk about it.</p>

<p>But it is just not, he's not doing the same thing and I feel just that is holding me back, that I don't have the will with which to be fucked around. I'm still working. I really feel like I've paid my dues this year, I should get some dividends. And these are the dividends I want.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you deserve those things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I really think I do. And things I always wanted to do, never have the money, never have the time. And wasn't in a physical location where it was feasible for me to take dancing lessons and weaving classes and shit.</p>

<p>And last year I just didn't know enough. I didn't have the possibility for developing. This year I do. I'm going to take them, if only to get disenchanted with them in the middle of August.</p>

<p>And I'm getting this low-key resistance that makes me feel eventually guilty as if I was in some way damaging Murphy. Not being good enough to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you agree with that though?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well it gets very hazy because there are all these other things, like you are going to be in (inaudible). Maybe I'm not giving him enough reassurance and strength and not warm enough to him all the time.</p>

<p>I guess I feel like I am mistreating him, but I really don't see myself getting any better with this kind of sickness. I seem to take my cue from certain things around him, which makes me respond in a certain way. Which in turn enhances whatever…</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't see it as this thing where you should or could really change and have that change work between you. And given that there is something I've been wondering for a couple of weeks which is, how come you're the person from New Hampshire and how come you didn't come together, both so that you (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I'm in therapy because he applied, and I applied here and I got accepted, and he's still waiting for (inaudible) so he really can't afford. (inaudible) I have an interview too and I talked to three people there, they all asked me how come he wasn't in scholarship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll tell you why I'm asking the difference and why they ask. They are very psychoanalytic and they do all this shit, the testing people before the treatment and diagnosis thing, given everything. But why they ask is so that they decide that there is something wrong with him. Why I ask is – well I'm not sure about that, I mean sure it sound like it in a way, but I don't (inaudible) and that is not to say that I don't know but more to ask, what was your self-diagnosis that you came to because of all these problems in your relationship. Or that you came separately. I mean what was happening that you viewed in a way that you should have stuck with therapy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was freaking out about how I was not comfortable with myself. And I feel very bad about it, and very lousy about the whole thing. And that I was in a situation where everything looked hopeless and I was just not getting anywhere and I was not coping with my own problems but I needed some kind of help.</p>

<p>And he had talked to me about therapy before, and I just didn't want to at that time, just didn't see the need to but I was just more involved with the stereo for that three hours, and I noticed that in the middle of that (inaudible) in the time hassles and shit like that, and not sure exactly what I was doing, and just feeling generally rotten about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come still all that doesn't say – I mean I guess some of that is that there are problems that you have that you are concerned are inseparable from him. But you talk about him an awful lot, and he is really a presence for you, and now I wonder well how come you in turn didn't see him to get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It never occurred to us, really. That is why. Right now, right now he really needs a shrink but I know it and he knows it, and he needs a push. But I don't know, I don't know what we can do. We can't afford $25 (inaudible)</p>

<p>When will they be taking the (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well they are already having the waiting list now, but the waiting list is just a list I don't think he'll have any problem because one thing (inaudible). more and more incentives. It is just a (inaudible) and the membership fee is going to be $10 and then up under (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It gets really worse. I don't know how to help him anymore. I don't know what to do. He's feeling rotten about himself because he's not getting a job but at the same time he's not really working at it. He doesn't know where to go.</p>

<p>Getting a job is really confusing to him, especially if you've never really done it before. And he just doesn't know what to do. And I really feel that it is not him, it is the industry. There are no jobs to be had.</p>

<p>Life is putting him through, hell it's putting me through all that. I don't know what to do, that is the truth. I'd kill if I had to stand in the middle of a concentric circle of kind of frustration and resentment. I'm just sitting and radiating resentment towards everything. Life challenges present everything.</p>

<p>I was talking last week about Chrissie, and since then I've managed to (inaudible) feel to a great deal of resentment against her. Don't want to talk to her, and she's talked to Murphy a few times..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you are angry at her…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I'm really pissed at her. I just don't need it right now. I'm having enough trouble coping with how (inaudible) without having to cope with Chrissie's little fuck-ups about Murphy. I'm beyond caring right now, it is just one more (inaudible) to think about. I just turn rabid every time I think about it.</p>

<p>I just don't know what to do. I'm not relating with people … which is weird because we had the best day yesterday. We felt so close and we felt so good, that I came home from work and I washed my hair and I took a shower cleaned up and (inaudible)</p>

<p>And he came home… well I wanted to see him, I just didn't want to have this outpouring of innate deception.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So seeing him was seeing the demand placed on you for a kind of response that you didn't want to give.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I would have given perhaps if it hadn't been demanded.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When he asked for it that much,</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then it turned me off. I kind of go on these strange (inaudible) that song about ‘that's the way I thought it should be'. Every time I hear it, it makes me clutch in the pit of my stomach. It was on the radio and I was reading Chrissie's message and I was going through all these amazing changes and was really grinding. (inaudible) all these things so hurt and so painful. And he was kind of drunk and all I was getting was blatant kind of sexual sentimentality and I just start freaking out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were really sensitized by your reading (inaudible) eventual crushing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) but it was so hideous at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, there wasn't anything funny …</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was a really painful experience. And I don't know what I'm going to do (inaudible). But then I know (inaudible). And I lie.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. So what do you mean. Because you know you're going to go home…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I don't know how I'm going to relate to him. I know I'm going to lie to him until he finally says, ‘You're lying to me', and pushes the issue until I explode.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well fuck it, why not… if you can find out anyway I mean I think there's a lot to be said about telling the truth regardless of whether he can find out anyway. So if you can find out anyway, then I really don't understand what the point of view is of pushing it away.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I kind of hope that if I just ignore the whole thing (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You keep on holding that despite all evidence to the contrary (laughter.)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is really true. I just don't want to go home and have this big scene about how we're relating, especially sexually. I just don't have the patience for it. I will just bop him over the head and leave. I just won't take it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you think you should take it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I think I should do something about it, yeah. I think I should tell the truth.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the bopping him over the head is in response to what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he gets doggish and guilty about the whole thing about he being good enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get pissed off (inaudible)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I (inaudible) like there is something wrong with me and I really fucked up, and I don't want to have to put him back together right now. I'm having too much trouble holding myself together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you mean you are kind of thinking if he gets into a mess about it, it is going to be one more problem for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And right now I feel like I'm really – I am really fucked up and have to find some way out of it, and I'm going to need all the help I can get. So (inaudible) you know, really.</p>

<p>The problem is not you right now, the problem is me so cool it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what happens when you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh I don't, I just never do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well why don't you say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sure has a lot of convictions. Then I'll kind of get the feeling that he feels that I'm not giving him enough support, and he's felt that he's holding together for the last couple of months and that now he needs my support and I'm not giving it to him. And that he's giving me more than I'm giving to him. And that (inaudible)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So in essence if you were to make that statement, that he'd resent you more than he does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you think that was just or unjust?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of the conclusion that it may very well be just, but I just haven't (inaudible) and then I have (inaudible). And then after that I guess kind of makes me resent him all the more, for making me keep a tally sheet of (inaudible). It was kind of the whole reason we got involved with one another, was it was so… when you care for someone and they kind of (inaudible) to you about what they need, and can help them, and can then give very strongly. And continue to give with a great deal of concern for the other person.</p>

<p>He was the first person I ever found who gave to me the way in which I felt I was giving to other people. So there was an exchange of concern and consideration and just sensitivity toward the other person. And now I feel continually guilty that I'm not giving him enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because the balance has shifted?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. That I'm not giving him enough sensitivity, that I'm not giving him enough love, enough support, enough time, enough anything. I'm upset.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is the enough norm that your measuring yourself against. Is the norm of reciprocity or is the norm of some absolute…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Reciprocity and also what he feels he needs. (inaudible) when I need support, when I need help, when I need somebody to pull me together I guess, there have been occasions when (inaudible). When I get turned on I get (inaudible) and I guess I feel this is my fault we're not getting something.</p>

<p>I think it is more of a balance between me and my fuck-ups and also his demands. As my feeling right now is that to me I'm totally screwed up. My intellectualization it isn't in me to, especially when he's under pressure. And it might be possible that my response to him, he gets fucked up just to withdraw. He just gets too fucked up for me to cope with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think that is what he's doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm positive. It is kind of a defense mechanism, but I just don't know what to do about that, how to help him. So I withdraw, rather than find out, really find out (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd rather just think you'd prefer not to give this time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you think that you gave him …</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just so confused. It's strange, the little things that upset me. Like really being together, I mean physically together. When we first started sleeping together he was the first person I could comfortably sleep with my arms around, with our bodies intertwined. And lately I've been very uncomfortable. I just don't want him to treat me that way. He sleeps mostly half on top of me, with his legs his arms straddling me. And any movement I make he feels right away, so I can't move. And the skin contact with one another we sweat a lot so it's very sticky, and I just feel very, very uncomfortable. I'm kind of pinned down, literally.</p>

<p>So I've wanted to sleep that way often any more, I start feeling very, very warmly towards this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you feel very warmly towards this, is that like saying – well all these unpleasant things that come cancel out because he loves it. But …</p>

<p>CLIENT: But also because I'm like he is, because I like the contact thing. The unpleasant things don't bother you. So most of the time they do. I just get hot and muggy, there is no emotional connotation whatever, there is just this person who is half on top of me and he's sticky, and he's sweating a lot, and he's breathing in my ear and I want him off.</p>

<p>And of course last night I just phoned him, said I wouldn't sleep over just don't feel like it. And moved over to my apartment. I know he was feeling down, but I was feeling downer.</p>

<p>So, but this really upsets him. It upsets him when I do what I did, because I do it more often. But every time, half the time I do it he sounds really disappointed, and the rest of the time he doesn't care. I kind of feel guilty.</p>

<p>He's more comfortable sleeping (inaudible). He has the problem because I'm less comfortable and he's more comfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think we'll stop here. I don't think we finished that therapy thing because one thing we didn't talk about was this aspect of what's the concept of going to therapy together, and like he kind of smiled and hadn't thought about it. But I think it is an interesting concept to think what that does to thinking about all this the kind of problems that you're having. It may not be that you'd want to do this but if you'd like to look at and understand…</p>

<p>Also I want to start therapy for him. There is (inaudible) session.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Where would you go to make that application?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess he'd just come in here and after than he'd just … The thing is…</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 17. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know I've been thinking about (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know while we were talking about what I was going to say, because I don't have nothing to say. We were discussing what I was saying when I got here because I can't think of anything to say. (inaudible). I was telling her today that I think I never trusted men (ph) (inaudible). And she says, "Now all you ever talk about in your sessions and I said, "All she ever talks about is men." I said, "Well, yeah, because I feel like it's the only problem I have and." (Ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying you (inaudible at 0:01:08.2) and she asked you that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...when she asked you if that all you talked about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at all—no because you know if I know her well enough to even tell her when I'm coming, I wouldn't be embarrassed, you know, anything that, you know that I would tell about this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is—well you know I'll just tell what we were—I was saying that I didn't think I'd ever be attracted to anybody. And so she brought of the fact that well sure you will if you know a good friend but you have to be friendly. And you know I've been friendlier but and I says, "Well it didn't work with the people I like," but she brought up a good point that very often when we like people it's because we felt they liked us, so why couldn't it work the other way around. Why couldn't a man like a woman if he thought that she liked him (inaudible at 0:02:14.4); do you agree with that or you think it works differently? Do you think it works differently with men?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you asking me if I think men are different than you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, than women?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I rather have you play a role with it I guess.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it is true but very often the bases of a woman's attraction to a man is because he seems to be attracted to her; that has often happened to me. And she suggested that well why couldn't it work the other way around? Why couldn't a man become attracted to woman on the bases that he thinks that she's attracted to him?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why you really aren't thinking about that (overlapping). 0:02:57.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Except there have been people that I have known, that have known that I liked them, and it didn't work; except maybe they weren't the right people or maybe I hadn't been friendly that long. Maybe I haven't met that many people since I've changed. I don't know if you know that I've changed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you telling me because you'd like me to know that you have?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) like yeah. I'm friend—I've always been friendly (inaudible). Not too friendly but I—well I'll tell you another thing that I think that I've been thinking is wrong with me. I think I'm (inaudible) to men, especially the ones that I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel that I'm... that I'm too much, that I'm too aggressive, too domineering, talk too much and act too much—behave too much like a know it all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like a what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Know it all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of smart you mean? (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just overwhelming, I overwhelm them, that I seem oppressive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You bear down on them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel that—I feel that this is why people that I have gone with and known or have gotten close to, to a certain extent, feel that my presence is oppressive. I guess I was comparing myself to my friend who seems more different. Well I'll tell you what happened, you know the last person that I you told about this friend, he saw me in a public school, he goes around subbing, the one I told you that was writing a book... (inaudible at 0:05:04.8).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You did tell me (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...sometime. And I told you that I found out that he was writing a book?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't tell me that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I did—I mean, maybe I did—no I didn't tell you. I'm trying to say yes I did find out. And so she's my friend, you know, the one I just saw (inaudible at 0:05:32.8) she a teacher at (inaudible) so she had met him a couple of times. And she asked him, wanted to know why he subbing (inaudible) he told her that he tried tell himself that he's a writer. Well he never told me that he was a writer, but yet he told her. So there must be something about me that he feels that I wouldn't—that he can't—maybe she seems more sympathetic or more, more something, I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me that there must be some quality that's different about you that makes him feels uncomfortable about talking to you about writing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or to tell me that he wrote. But he doesn't give me a chance because when I'm with him he ask me so many questions about myself, he makes me talk about myself. So in a way, it's not my fault and I tired not to do this you know. I try to steer the conversation away from myself. But he seems so curious about me and yet he would talk to somebody else about himself. I don't know why he won't talk to me about himself and he'll talk to someone else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see (inaudible) that (inaudible) like when he's with you he does talk about you, and when he's with her he talks about him and I'm wondering what that mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) he doesn't care about himself (inaudible). Maybe he wants to impress her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course she asked him a few questions—I've never asked him why subs and doesn't do anything—I've never asked him that—why are you only a sub?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe it's because you don't ask him questions.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I wouldn't want to ask a person that, you know, because I think what they decide to do is their own business and it's (inaudible 0:07:39.3) well, you know, I have a regular job and you don't, why not. There's some of these questions I don't think I should ask but there are questions that I do ask, of course, like I might have asked him, you know, well he's Italian so I might say well you're Italian have you ever felt (inaudible 0:08:10.2)—just anything like something like that I would ask.</p>

<p>But—well I guess what I'm trying to get out of all of this is that I'm beginning to feel that—now remember last week I told you that I thought the other guy thought that I was a fool and weak and foolish and I made a fool (inaudible). And this, this time I feel that—well maybe even with the other one, I feel that I talk too much and that I make too many jokes, and I'm just not gentle enough... I'm not feminine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying (inaudible) about what you're saying that you (inaudible at 0:08:59.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He says that I do (inaudible) (noise). I guess, I guess what I'm talking about to the extent of the conversation that I was having with the girl that (inaudible). And she's sort of a gentle type person—she's the one that my other friend had setup for this blind date, this is the girl that I said, you know, she, you know, she's very smart and she's real nice because she doesn't talk, I mean she doesn't say much. And I think this stems from a conversation that we had, the two of us yesterday, about the fact that there are women in our school that seem to attract the men more and they are women who don't talk much, I think I talked to you about this before, is that the women who seemed the most quiet seem to attract men.</p>

<p>Now even though she's quiet, she did say that she wonders what goes on when the men are alone with these women, you know, what keeps them interested. So naturally my being paranoid or whatever I feel that I must be too much the other way; that I'm too aggressive. I've never been thought of as an aggressive person. I've usually been thought of a timid shy person. And all of sudden I imagined myself as this oppressive, dominating, overbearing person. I don't know why I see myself before but I really (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can you see, (inaudible at 0:11:00.9)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like if I'm talking about a movie with someone that I saw it with, they'll say, "Well how did you like this?" and I'll give my opinion. And, you know, and I don't try to impress on anyone my opinion about anything but if they're talking about it, and if it's a subject that I'm interested in, then I'll contribute and I'll talk about it, you know, an equal amount. But back in the background, when I think back it seems as if I'm talking too much or that I shouldn't. Well the reason why I said I went to a movie with this guy, the same one, and (inaudible) discuss, you know, the same, and I'll discuss it too. And I just feel that afterwards I've talked too much or I'll say things or. 0:12:04.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you talk more than he does?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think so. Well, I'll tell you something (inaudible), I know this is really getting to be a twisted thing. I have another friend who was talking to me about the friend that I was talking to about the one that's.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I was saying, you know—I was telling the other friend that she's really intelligent and my other friend said to this other woman—by the way this other woman talks a lot, she's really intelligent and she let's you know she is. Like she gives whole lectures. She'll say, "Oh yeah, she's really intelligent but she doesn't flaunt it." Now I don't think that she making a dig at me, but it made me feel that even though my friend read books and what not, she never talked about them. And maybe that's considered not flaunting your intelligence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Considered what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not flaunting your intelligence. Not that I feel that I have all that intelligence to flaunt but I just feel that I should keep my interest in myself more because other women don't do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) I'm having problems here I see you going in the direction—it disturbs me to think that you might go in the direction of getting quiet. Now that may be just my (inaudible) but it disturbs me because it sometimes falls in line with (inaudible) whether I'm supposed to be quiet or not (inaudible). And furthermore it bothers me because I don't necessarily think that, personally I don't feel that being quiet necessarily attracts men. But, you know, it's hard for me because I (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So do I.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So do I. I'm very much. (Overlapping)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Okay. But, but, what, what I do (inaudible) that I think (inaudible) that I think there are ways of talking to people, which do make the conversation more interesting both of them, which, you know, there are ways and some of them has to do with how much each person talks. Some of them have to do with how gentle you are (inaudible), and certainly it has to do with a lot of things. But I think with the meeting, you have come to examine this. (Overlapping) I think your conclusion of this, okay, why (inaudible) bothering you? 0:14:42.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it's bothering me too. I don't— you know I guess I imagine myself trying to flaunt or putting "knowledge," you know, "knowledge is relevant" and but I don't think I do that. I, I don't think I'm argumentative. I don't think that I try to put the other person down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think you try to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just try to share interests with someone who's interested in the same thing. But it just seem like other women are so quiet in comparison, I almost see myself as aggressive, and I'm really being silly because I'm not. I couldn't be aggressive. 0:15:25.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But well okay, let me go back to what you were saying when you told me that, that the guy didn't tell you he was a writer. Now I really think (inaudible) your point but.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay well let's say why didn't he tell you that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could it be that you're interesting? But let's put it this way, if you want to know that kind of thing about somebody, I think there are questions you can ask but are not necessarily put down questions. You don't have to say, why are you only a substitute. (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) I have done that. He told me he plays tennis and he told me that he reads. In fact that's how we became acquainted because he was reading. And in fact he told me once that he was flattered because I had sat down and asked him, "What are you reading?" Now he said he can go a school, all of the high schools, and no regular teacher will ask you any questions, they won't talk to subs. And he said that he was glad that I had done this. Now maybe that was an aggressive thing to do, I don't know, but I don't know why I did that, I guess, I wasn't thinking (inaudible). 0:17:08.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) (overlapping) why you did what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I asked him, "What are you reading?" he told me he was reading (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see. Well it sounds like, you know, from what you're saying about that, that he felt flattered that you were paying attention to him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what he told me later. He says, you know, "You sat down and you asked me�"I didn't even remember that I had done that. But the first thing I knew is that he was talking to me about this book he was reading. And even at that first conversation—and then he found out that we live in the same neighborhood (inaudible). And so he said, "I don't think if you hadn't sat down I would never talked to you. I mean it may have taken me longer to talk to you but I was so glad that you did this." And then you know after I had asked him what are you reading, and then he started talking to me about it. And so he told me read—and I have asked him questions—why he didn't tell me he wrote, I don't know. 0:18:04.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you ask him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't—how can ask a person, are you a writer?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) somebody told me that you wrote; that's very interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he knows.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you say, I'm very (inaudible) why you didn't tell me that before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I already know that he wrote.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No but see what I'm saying is you say to him, I wondered why, you know, I'm wondering now and I found out today, I wonder why you didn't tell me before, and then you find out; rather than thinking he was lying (inaudible). 0:18:52.0</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I can do it, even though he knows that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) point that he knows it. The point is why didn't he tell you. The point is it tells you something about you and about him (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, you know, he talked to me a lot about a lot of things before I found out—well the way I found out (inaudible) and I saw the manuscript. And during that, before that, he would ask me a lot of questions about myself. Of course it could be that she happen to ask him that question. 0:19:39.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See here you are (inaudible) thinking about it, (inaudible) why do you do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I will ask him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why have you done that (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why have I what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why have you not thought of asking him before?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because this all fits in with just what I'm thinking about myself. Not only am I oppressive and aggressive and dominating and a know it all; I'm not sympathetic. Here's my gentle friend, you know, and she—and he feels maybe she really cares, this is what I'm imagining, and I seem hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see, okay, I understand that, that's all right; okay, we'll go with that. I want to make my point thought, too...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you know what point I'm making?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I shouldn't wonder why (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No not that you shouldn't wonder. I'm making a point that you give yourself a lot of grief by imagining and wondering without asking (inaudible). 0:20:38.9</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yeah—I think there are some questions that you can ask. I think there are some questions that you can't ask like, why don't you work?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, okay, but I'm saying, you know, maybe the line—maybe the line isn't drawn (inaudible)? 0:21:05.2</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I did with him, well I'll tell you. One day I was (inaudible) listening to (inaudible). I called—I was really disgusted—and I said, "How can I explain all this." You know I told him that I felt that he thought that I was interested in him (overlapping). He really laughed at me. He laughed that I thought that he could be thinking this way that he would feel threatened. I don't remember everything that I said but anyway I felt that oh well, he can see through me anyway. I might as well tell him that I know that he could see through or tell him that I know what he's thinking.</p>

<p>And then he finally told me that—then I got into this thing about how I feel that I'm too clingy and he told me that, that I should behave the way I think is (inaudible). And then if a man, or if any man was threatened because of this, then that's his problem. And he said besides sometimes, if you don't show that you like someone, maybe you'd never find out how he feels about you; occasionally this can happen. And then he says, when you show that you—when you like a person and you don't want to show it, he thinks that then you, you're fearing rejection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that makes a lot of sense, but I don't believe that he didn't feel a little threatened; I don't believe that, but I don't care. If he wants to lie about it, what else can you do? 0:23:00.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You do care it sounds like, but it's okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I care but I don't care because I'm not terribly emotional the way I was about the other one. I think about it but it doesn't tear into me. In fact I'm not really hurt about him not telling me that he's (inaudible) writer, I just—it just had implications about what kind of a person or how I'm coming off (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It sounds like what you really thinking about in yourself is; am I too aggressive, do I want to be more gentle, that kind of question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's so funny I've always thought of myself as, you know, a gentle person except that lately, in the last couple of years, I do tend to feel confident and certain, you know, about certain areas. And I do like, and I do, and do like to talk and I do like conversation with someone that wants to talk to me (inaudible at 0:24:18.7). But I might be coming off aggressive. Sometimes people who grow up timid over do it. But, of course, you don't see me in social settings, so you wouldn't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). But I, I hear what you're saying but in some areas (inaudible at 0:24:37.7).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Relative.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Definitely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope I'm not opinionated. I'll have to think about that. Yeah, sometimes I'm opinionated but I don't think, I don't think that I'm, I don't think it's offensive, now that I think about it.</p>

<p>Well—I'll tell you what, you know, like today about the 12 days off with one of the teachers at work. And I said something about, well, if I had wanted to take vow of obedience of chastity and poverty, I would have joined a convent, saying that I won't work. Well sometimes when I give my opinion, I think I do in a way, I try to talk it off lightly so that it comes off half serious and half kind of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Flipper?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...flipper, yeah, that's a good word. So I think by doing that I do avoid getting into a, you know, where things are really nasty sounding, opinionated and hard-nosed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it is sort of a way to lighten it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I do sort of try to toss things off if I'm giving a definite opinion.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you do feel a pretty definite opinion? (inaudible at 0:26:12.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah in as much as I think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or I might say something like, you know, (inaudible) really couldn't write music. The friends that I have that lack a talent in music might not (inaudible at 0:26:40.0), you know, oh ghee, that's really a nice piece, its almost mediocre. And, you know, I try not to make it seem very important. I don't think I (inaudible), I don't know.</p>

<p>But like I was saying, but this whole thing came up at the fact that—in fact, you know, we were saying that it does seem like a lot of women who don't talk seem to be attractive to a lot men. And why are we saying that they talk, because we've known them, and we have never heard them say anything. But I feel like you do—you probably believe in some of things women's lib was saying that women shouldn't conform to these stereotypes. And I feel that (inaudible) well not strongly but (Laughter). 0:27:37.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:27:37.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes it is. I do I kind of resent a feeling of guilty about it. I don't want to change basically I just hope that I'm not offensive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well here's the thing though. I think what you're saying, you can't always have your cake and eat too, might be offensive to some people. You might come to a point to where the choice of (inaudible at 0:28:11.5). It may come down to, do I have to change that or do I want to do it and change some people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't, I don't talk a lot. There are some women that talk more than I do. Like if I'm at a lunch table and they're talking the school business and what not, I really don't say that much because I know a lot of—I'm not one of the strong females around there—one of the, the ones that get up in meetings talk and leader, I'm not like that. My—I'm talking me with personal relationships I'm not one of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I understand you're not a group leader.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm not a group leader. And even at a lunch table, I'm not the one that (inaudible at 0:29:10.1) forth, you know, like some women.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what you were saying, you know, about (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you say I forgot what it was?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh it was something about Italian Opera—I know opinion, you know opinion...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what was it you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know I might... (overlapping). I might say something about, you know, older music, you know, how sassy it is or might sound like a the piano and (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it was I think you said like, "None of the Italians can write music," or something like that. Does that sounds like something you said?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I might say, you know, oh, you know—well yes if, well I wouldn't say this unless I was talking to someone that already knew my opinion about—if I was talking to person I don't know real well, and we were talking about Italian Opera, of course if I don't know them well, I just listen and smile. (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay well what I'm going to do is to say like if I was in the conversation with you—I'm trying to see what my reaction (inaudible at 0:30:32.1) And it would be, "Well ghee, she knows a lot about music. Ghee she has a pretty well formed opinion." And then, from then on, it depends—if I felt weak in music, I might be scared by my own opinion. If I felt strong music, and sort of felt comfortable with people who had strong opinions, I might kind of laugh and enjoy it. But it would be something that you have to hold your—it would make me feel like (inaudible) it was something I had to hold opinion against—well sort of making of fun if I knew it and enjoyed that kind music.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I only do it with people that I know, you know, that know me. You know, if I finally met you for the first time and you said I went to hear, you know, (inaudible) last night and I really like it, I wouldn't, I wouldn't (inaudible), I wouldn't say anything to you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay but now I have a feeling like you think I said to you that's not a good think to do, is that right? 0:31:45.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I don't think you said (inaudible). Well I don't want you to think that I'd, you know, that I'd lambaste someone as soon as I meet them but, you know, when I think—this older man in school he...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But wait, I wasn't straight because I wasn't saying you don't think you should do it. All I'm saying is here's what my reaction would be if I were weak and if I was strong, I might enjoy it because it's really fun...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible). (inaudible at 0:32:06.3) what I'm saying is who I am.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I have a friend who, well he's an older man, he's quite smart and he hates (inaudible) and knows I (inaudible) so I always talk about I went to a (inaudible) concert and I know he's going to say, "Oh you fool."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I do it because I know he's going to react. (Overlapping). (inaudible) and that's enjoyable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now the friend that I had last year—I talked about that last time, I felt that he thought I was a know-it-all. But I don't talk him about any topic because we don't have much in common. With him, it's just small talk and jokes and what not. I don't try anything. And, you know, and I'll say, you know, I'll say things that, you know he'll laugh, and he'll say something and I'll laugh. And that seems good, you know, on the surface we can, we can get along without even talking. But like I always thought that he liked the women who didn't say anything.</p>

<p>So what it sounds like I'm telling you is that, is that nothing should be important to a man but whether he can get along with a woman. But a woman—a man should—what, what it sounds like I'm saying to you is that a woman should be judged only by her personality and that obviously I can't have a great one. Now that's the opinion, I think, but I don't have that opinion. I'm thinking that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what you think you're saying today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that I'm saying this I think I've said this to other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That—say that again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That I feel that I have given the impression, to you and couple of other friends, that I feel that a man should prefer me because, because I have, because I'm interested in things and I can converse. And actually maybe I'm wrong. Maybe what I talk about is dull and maybe I and maybe I'm not—maybe I'm really boring. Maybe they're thinking, "Well God, wonder who does she think she is," you know, "She's really boring." I rather take out this other girl too, she quiet. Sharon is, she just rattles on and on about nothing." You know, maybe I'm...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well why don't you first find out if that's the impression you're giving?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Giving who?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought you said that's what you thought you've been saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel that I explained this to you and I might be wrong. You know maybe...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. What you—(inaudible) and you don't, basically, you don't me to think you are saying that in case you are wrong? 0:35:17.4</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Because I'm sure—you this other friend of mine that only cares about looks?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute, what do you mean wrong?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my mother talked to me about the word wrong too, every time I used the word wrong. You mean I'm saying that I'm wrong?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you have the idea that either you're wrong or right...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that I might (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if it doesn't (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Are you saying that you don't because you don't know me socially?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No that's not really what I'm saying. I'm saying (inaudible) so many things at the same time—for one thing, what's bothering me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...is that you're so careful about what you're thinking. It's almost like you don't want to really disagree with me, you don't want to hold a different opinion than I do. 0:36:40.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't want to be one of these people that goes around with a false image of themselves. I don't want to go around thinking that I might be interesting to talk to when actually I might be boring to talk to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to go around giving a false impression.</p>

<p>PATIENT: False impression of myself. And I feel that whatever—if another person has an opinion about me, naturally, I'd feel they must be right and I'm wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what I'm asking you, why is that true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because other people, well that old saying of other people feel differently (inaudible at 0:37:24.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sounds like saying the way that other people count 100 percent, the way I see it count 0.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I am saying that. I think you're absolutely right. I think that's—this is why I so often care what other people think, what some people think is because I feel so, they think so it must be true. Well even like this guy that I used to like, you know, or still it's waning. (Overlapping).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That guy, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know how I feel, it's in limbo of what—it's waning, it's getting better anyway. Like, you know, like if he'll see me in school and there's a confusion around me—kids acting all sorts of ways and I'm thinking, I can hardly function because I'm thinking, "Oh he thinks I'm a bad disciplinarian. He thinks I'm a bad teacher."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:23.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really I'm thinking that "Oh God he (inaudible)." Not only does he not care for me he doesn't respect me either. He must think I'm an awful teacher. He sees all of this confusion around my classroom.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's like you're so busy thinking about him, you can even deal with the confusion in your classroom. (inaudible) Oh my.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can deal with it but it's worrying me at the same time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) yeah, like a third of your mind is over there and thinking, (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe he doesn't—and then I think, well even if he does think that he doesn't know what the real situation is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like (inaudible at 0:39:03.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah but anyway that all tied into my thinking, what another person thinks about me, so it's true. You know, I don't know why I should care so much about his opinion because. 0:39:24.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I got something to say about how you care about his opinion. What I'm concern with you don't seem to care about your own opinion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) that's true, that's where I'm very weak. I'm very weak in considering my own opinion as well. But you know you always talk that way, you don't see yourself the way others do. And aren't people always told that because, so that they won't have a...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because it's right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...false impression of themselves. Suppose I go around thinking that I'm so interesting and I notice that people are reacting to me a different (inaudible). But suppose I did, I don't always, but suppose I did, wouldn't I have to alter what I feel about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds reasonable to pay some attention to how other people react, but then you form your own opinion too. Like how about paying some attention to your own opinion?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because the way they react to us depends a little bit on them doesn't it? Well you know what, like my friend was telling me today, she says it's not true if you're not attracted to men. Well suppose I went around thinking that I'm attracted to men and obviously I'm not, isn't that a (inaudible) assumption or?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get what you're saying it's like if you follow your own opinions, you're afraid of really (inaudible at 0:41:00.6).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But don't you feel that's true?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I actually thought that you could choose—you could be led astray by always listening to other people's opinions (inaudible). I see your problem.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well how do you know what's right, you just (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well that's a good question but I don't think we can answer that. But what I'd like (inaudible) think about (inaudible) everybody else is more liked than you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible). Can I tell you something—I know it's getting (inaudible at 0:41:42.3) time. I just remember the last year I told her that this guy had this thing about sophistication, and he told me what he thought sophistication was. Well, you know, I had a chance—I had six months to observe this woman that he thought was sophisticated. And this is the one that, oh well—did I ever tell you that she saw me reading and she said, you know, "What are you reading that stuff for?" you know, why (inaudible). Just, in other words, I found that her sophistication was a surface thing.</p>

<p>And then I had found out about him that he—well here he is, you know, and here's—well first of all, he's black, you know, and I found very black bourgeois. Before this other thing happened I thought, my opinion of him before this episode occurred, before I fell for him, I'll just put it that way, I thought he was crude, kind of bourgeois, not even the most refined member of the bourgeois. And, you know, like I've been to a couple of parties where he was before—by the way, I was a party last, a week ago Friday and he was there and if was there with my new friend, the friend that I play tennis with, and of course I was going through all sorts of thoughts. I was wondering if he noticed that if was with somebody else. And, well I don't know what he noticed he hasn't said anything to me about. But anyway—and I saw him at a party a week before that and I noticed that he only gets along with certain groups of people. In fact, I've noticed that even, even, you know, in the ensuing months after that, you know, since then I've notice that, that he's only comfortable with a certain group of people and people that are, that are a lot of people that I (inaudible). And certainly he doesn't get along with a lot of different groups of people and not cosmopolitan in anyway. He doesn't get along with a lot of people outside of a group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He's limited socially.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah he, well yeah, yeah okay limited social. But I wanted to—I didn't want to say limited socially because I didn't, I wanted to explain to you exactly what I meant. 0:44:26.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm not (inaudible) you know, I'm not saying (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And here you are you're going to give me a whole 10 reasons why you're saying this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm saying, what I'm saying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...is that I'm no longer hung up about that because I have seen, you know, what he is; in other words they say, "Consider the source." In other words, it doesn't mean the other person's opinion is always right. Sometimes they're just mouthing off (ph). Sometimes they're values—they have twisted values.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you saying that before, and sometimes when you think your opinion counts nothing, you're considering the source, you're not considering? (inaudible). (Overlapping).</p>

<p>PATIENT: First of all, this may sound like—this is a (inaudible) example of what I'm talking about. In other words, the word sophisticated has many meanings. I would call a person sophisticated who, who maybe (inaudible) languages and did travel and who was knowledgeable in the arts, humanities and all these sorts of things, maybe along with a certain manner but they might even behave silly, and I might think that they were sophisticated because of inner qualities that they have, a certain substance. Where I have found out that his idea of sophistication is perhaps the way you cross legs, your manner and air or veneer. And now that I know that, your opinion isn't worth two cents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I see what you're saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I don't think it's a sophisticated person is always limited socially; they can be, but usually they're not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's not only that now you feel different, you feel differently about sophistication. It's not just term, but it's like now you don't feel like you're so bad as you thought you were.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Once in a while I'm hung up on what he thinks of me but I have enough, I've thought enough about things that, that I, you know I have a background of thinking on it to draw from. 0:46:41.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you say that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, you know, your thoughts are one thing; your emotions are another.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. And it almost sounds like what you're doing is trying to think about it enough so that you can separate your feelings about you from his feelings about you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. (inaudible) socially limited. But it was found here at conferences say well he's socially limited but I didn't want to qualify that (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) right, right. 0:47:23.7</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I'll certainly think about that because—yeah I really do think that another person's opinion of me is valid and mine is invalid, I really do. I suppose if, if you believe in your own opinion of yourself you'd start to have more confidence. And if you're confident you sort of, maybe you'd do more of the right things or you maybe come off differently. And maybe people are not judging you as harshly as you think sometimes.</p>

<p>Well I'm glad you told me that I shouldn't try to change and become quiet.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now wait. I said that that's my opinion. Now, I don't want you—just think about what we were just now talking about, I don't want you to (inaudible) because I feel that way. I want you to think about whether you want to change or not. (Overlapping).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think maybe what you're saying is that I shouldn't want to change because I think it was what another person wanted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that's exactly what I'm saying. 0:48:51.1</p>

<p>PATIENT: If I think that there's something offensive about me, perhaps I might want to change to please myself. But if I think it's offensive to someone else, I mean, maybe it's not necessarily that important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It depends on how much you care about offending the other person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And what offends them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well like some people smoke and they know smoking offends people, but they don't stop smoking, or they talk too much and not talk enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay, fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's a good time for you (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is a good time for me. Do you rather come in one week or two weeks?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Two weeks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two weeks.</p>

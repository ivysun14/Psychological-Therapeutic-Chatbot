<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where shall we start today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like things are starting to get like a little more into a routine, which makes me feel a little bit better. I do feel like I've had lots of ups and downs just trying to figure everything out, in terms of being back at school. I felt like—so Wednesday is the day that Trae goes to his daycare and the other days he's home, either with my mom or with my mother-in-law.</p>

<p>So we had to get up really, really early cause he needs to be there—well he doesn't have to be—but it starts at 8 to 5 are the hours, so we feel like if we're spending all this money, we should probably have him there at 8.</p>

<p>And so we just got up really early cause it still just takes us a long time to pack up all the milk, and all the stuff that he needs, and then we dropped him off. Then I went to school and I was picking him up that day. And then I picked him up—and I was looking forward to picking him up all day long, but by the time I picked him up I felt like I had just not gotten anything accomplished at school. [00:01:05]</p>

<p>And part of me just felt like—what's the point? I'm away from him all these hours, we just spent all this money for him to be there for a day, but I felt like my whole day was just running back and forth between the nursing station at our school and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just felt like—I still am struggling to find a way to be effective with my time when he is with someone else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it just feels like so much of it is taken up by pumping -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: that I'm just like, "Well, what's the point?" (laughs) You know, if I were with him I wouldn't be pumping and, you know -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: but then I wouldn't be able to be getting work done. But I think right now it's like (pause for .02 seconds) trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're still not totally away from him really, cause you're having to pump and take care -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and part of me kind of likes that cause it's a chance in my day to do something for him even though I'm not with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that feels good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a connection. [00:01:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's nice to just stop and think about him and knowing that I'm doing something that is really good for him, even though I'm away from him, is nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But because it just feels like I'm at school in the library, and the lactation room is in a different building—I'm running back and forth and packing things up and unpacking once I get there. It just feels like it all takes so much time that I'm not being as efficient as I could be.</p>

<p>When I'm away from him I want to be really efficient cause I don't want to be away from him in the first place.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I feel like that was just kind of a low point. And I think because usually Todd will be able to pick him up on Wednesdays, but that was a day that he wasn't able to pick him up, so I needed to leave school pretty early just cause I was taking the bus. I wasn't sure how long that would take and I didn't want to be late, so it really made my window at school extra short.</p>

<p>And it just was like—that was kind of a low point of the week, just feeling like, "How are we going to sustain all this?" I was exhausted from getting up so early and it just felt like so much work to then go into work, you know (laughs) just tiring. [00:03:12]</p>

<p>But then there are other times when I feel like, "Oh, okay. This is a good day. I got more done than I would've expected and things are going okay." So I just feel like right now it's kind of those ups and downs of -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Figuring it out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a way to make pumping less of—like I know you said there's a lactation room—but what if you're in the library? Can you lug your stuff with you and —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: to the bathroom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I solved the problem because we get assigned TF offices on campus because I'm a teaching fellow. And usually I never even use my office cause I like the space in the library. The offices are also for meeting students who we're working with, but I usually meet with students in common areas so I never really would use my office in the past. [00:03:59]</p>

<p>But I asked this year if they could assign me to an office in the same building as the lactation room, and I just got the keys today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that will be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That will cut down on some of the back and forth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's really going to help, only now it's on the 3rd floor and then the lactation room is on the 2nd floor. So instead of all of that packing up and, you know, going between buildings, I think that can really help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that will cut down -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just got the keys. I just went and checked out the office today. So little by little I think things will fall into place. That will make a big difference, and then—like when my mom has been coming, usually we'll stay and chat. I'll go over all these things that are happening, like just explain the two bottles she should use up first—just all this little logistical stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this morning—and I'm also at the mercy of the bus schedule cause I'm taking the bus to school—so this morning, I missed one of the buses. She got there and there was one coming, and I could've made that one but I just didn't have my act together and then we got talking. [00:05:03]</p>

<p>So then the next one wasn't until a whole half hour later.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that kind of stuff I feel like -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: and that kind of frustrated me -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you get into more of a routine with her you'll be able to -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: have that window be shorter -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: the overlap.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think that will be good. I felt like this morning I was just—usually we do a better the night before, Todd and I both, of getting stuff ready and washing pump parts, which I feel like I do endlessly.</p>

<p>Just having stuff more ready to go, but this morning—we were tired last night, didn't do it, went to bed and then this morning Todd had to rush out to a meeting, so I was kind of scrambling to get all that stuff done. Then I was thinking I should be better about just getting that stuff organized at nigh, so that I can be more efficient in the morning too. But then it does feel weird—like I was saying to my mom, "Oh, I don't have the stuff done. I'm going to miss this bus that I wanted to get. I feel like now I'm kind of wasting time cause you're here." [00:06:04]</p>

<p>But when I was on the bus on the way to school I was thinking, "Well that's not a good way to look at it either though," because it was extra time that I had with him, and being able to catch up with my mom. I almost felt badly that I said that to her. I feel like right now I'm so on edge of like trying to figure out how much work I have and how much time I need to get it done. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm kind of like counting on these windows of like—I need to be very efficient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, but then I was thinking, "Well, no. That wasn't wasted time because I got to hang out with them."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For half an hour more. It was different time than you were anticipating having.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You anticipated it being work time. You had planned on that being work time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it ended up being (pause for .02 seconds) bonding time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause for .02 seconds) Hmm, so I just feel like trying to figure out (pause for .02 seconds) how to kind of balance it all because I think I have been doing a pretty good job of not needing to do work once I'm home. [00:07:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that Wednesday was, I think, another reason why I felt so badly about that day, cause I had—both of my classes are on Thursday—and because I didn't get a lot done at school on Wednesday, I had all this reading to do before class on Thursday.</p>

<p>So I was up late on Wednesday and that was just like, "Something is not right here," to spend all this time away from him yet then I still have all this work left to do for the next day. It felt like, you know, it just didn't feel like it was adding up. (pause for .03 seconds) So,</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound a little disappointed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I definitely was disappointed that day. But then I also felt like going into the weekend—I really didn't want to have to do a lot of work. I knew I would need to get a little bit done but I had a, um, just like a little brain-storm memo due for one class on Monday, and another thing for the class I'm an aide for. I needed to organize students into groups for Monday. [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I had extra stuff on top of the readings, or the typical work that I'd had the other two weekends, so I was like kind of nervous going into the weekend, thinking like, "How am I doing to get all of this done?" I knew I needed to get that memo done on Sunday because it was due at noon on Monday, and I know that morning Todd's mom was coming and I didn't know if I'd get to the library before then. So I knew I had to get it done.</p>

<p>And going into the weekend I was a little overwhelmed thinking, "I'm not quite sure how all of this is going to happen. Am I gonna need to take half of Saturday and go to school or at least get work done?" I wasn't sure how it was all going to work out.</p>

<p>And he took a nice, long nap on Saturday and I got work done, and another nap on Sunday -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: so it kind of like worked out. Then Sunday night I did a little bit of work after he went to bed, so that kind of felt good and I was like, "Oh, I actually did get this done." And it was something that I was a little bit worried about going into the weekend. [00:09:01]</p>

<p>So I feel like there've been just ups and downs, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And a lot of expectations going into things of how they're going to work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then depending on whether your expectations are met or not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. (pause for .03 seconds) And I feel like that little memo was a good kind of test too cause it was like the first kind of writing thing that we had to do—going back and submitting it and everything—and I was wondering how I was going to respond. Am I going to put too much pressure on myself to get this perfect and it was nice that it was just a—he called it a 'free-write'—just a brain-storming memo. </p>

<p>So I kept saying that to myself over and over again; I was like, "This is a brain-storming. Do not let yourself put too much time into it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not a paper.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I kind of knew when I submitted it on Sunday I was like, "If this were before Trae, I definitely would be reading this over one more time," but I kind of forced myself to just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let it go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: do it and submit it and be done. Todd was laughing too, and he was like, "You spent way too much time on that, even as a brain-storm," but I was like, "But it's Sunday night and I just submitted it and it's not due 'til Monday at noon." [00:10:07]</p>

<p>Usually I'd be working on it and read it over before then, so at least that was a baby-step in getting a little -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: bit better about it too, so (pause for .03 seconds) it is almost nice, like (pause for .02 seconds) I feel like I would have this expectation of perfection -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: before he was born and now it's almost like I can give myself an out. Like, I'm a mom, so it's okay if it's not perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in a way it's kind of nice to let myself feel that cause I don't think I ever would have let myself feel that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a lot more—and you're giving yourself that permission because you're a mom -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: but human beings are not perfect —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and because you're a human being, not everything is going to be perfect -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and good enough is good enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I wonder if you can do that same thing with some of your expectations about, you know, how much you're supposed to get done in a certain amount of time away from him. [00:11:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, I think (pause for .02 seconds) it's hard to find a line between planning -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: cause you're, how much planning do you need to do to feel like you're efficient without setting these very stringent expectations about amounts or products -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: so that you don't have to suffer this disappointment if a particular day or your chunk of time doesn't go the way you expected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (pause for .03 seconds) and I also think it would be better, like right now I'm still—because of the beginning of the semester—I'm feeling like I want to read everything of every article and I also know that, even from the other side as a TF, we'll assign readings that we just expect, "They're going to have to skim some of this cause it's a lot of reading."</p>

<p>So I know that even professors have that expectation, but usually I can let myself do that a little more into the semester when I'm just like a little bit more comfortable with the professors' expectations and stuff like that. [00:12:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I was feeling myself, like needing to read every word, and I think that's what was taking so long too. One of my classes does have a lot of reading with it and I was just trying to do it all, and I left it all for Wednesday, and it just didn't get done, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think that as I get more comfortable in the class too I can -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How to make decisions for yourself about what you think is important -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and what you want to get out of it</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you probably don't need every word to be part of a discussion to understand, you know, what the topic is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And so I always—I think that's always been something that has always been hard for me—to not read it totally, carefully, and I got better about that last year too. But I think was more once I understood the flow of class and what it was that we would usually tend to focus on in discussions and stuff like that. So I think I can get better with that too. [00:12:58]</p>

<p>But it is—it all just feels like it's kind of new right now, so it'll just be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's only two weeks in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so figuring it all out. (pause for .03 seconds) But I do—and I've been trying not to think too far into the future—but I feel like right now I'm just managing to get by with the workload but there's other stuff that will kind of pile on top that hasn't started for the semester so that feels like, I don't really want to think about it, cause I know that that will just be -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't need to. Be where you are.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is where you are in the semester -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and when that time comes, you'll have much more experience—you know, like with the morning routine of getting Trae to daycare, or doing the transition from you to your mom.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When you get to that place, you're going to be in a different place too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So right now you need to be where you are —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and meet the challenges that you have right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm (pause for .02 seconds) yeah and I know that's what I do need to do. And I think it will be just more getting comfortable with it all, and that it will be (pause for .02 seconds) that it will kind of like, things will fall more into place. [00:14:04]</p>

<p>And I'm also so glad about having Fridays home with him too, cause that was such a great—I feel like I was looking forward to last Friday so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's nice that it's the end of the week and then it came and we had such a nice day. Just kind of hung out and we met up with another mom who I'd met in the breastfeeding group. Her baby is only two days older than Trae so they're right at the same age.</p>

<p>We met up at the park and it was really just a nice day. At first, I wasn't sure cause I knew that I had that work over the weekend -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: so I was thinking, like before Friday actually came, like, "Am I going to feel like I should also be productive on this day when I really don't want to be?" I just want to focus on him.</p>

<p>He took a good nap so I got a little bit done during his nap, but other than that, we just had time together and that felt really good too. It's a nice way to end the week, after feeling so busy and having school be a focus, it's nice to then re-focus on him—not that he's not a focus on the other days—but just have it be about him on a Friday is nice. [00:15:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm. So knowing you have that peace to come back to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it was just a nice way to go into the weekend cause then we had a great weekend. We didn't really have any plans besides just plans with friends around, right around the corner so it was just nice to have a low-key weekend. Just have it be our little family; when during the week it just felt -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nice time to reconnect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) So I'm really—I think it just falls on the perfect day and I'm glad that -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like having the three-day weekend, sort of, sets you up nicely to be able to settle into that and enjoy that time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And reconnect, and slow down, and be present.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's enough of a transition, rather than having that time mid-week or something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, so that definitely was another high too. So there's a lot good. [00:16:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're doing a lot right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause for .02 seconds) Well it's pretty amazing, cause you're doing—I mean, it's such a switch to go back to school at, not just after time off, but you're now going back in a way that you've never done it before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Never have done grad school and parenthood at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So to be two weeks in and have had so many successes with balancing it and getting done what you really need to get done and still feel like you have a lot of quality time (pause for .03 seconds) that's a lot to take on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (pause for .02 seconds) and it does just feel like trying to figure it all out, but I do—it's nice like, I do feel like we can do it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It also feels good that Todd's here with me trying to figure it out too. He had his transition back to work a while ago but now it's kind of like a new transition because now both of us are back and trying to figure out our roles.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's not just needing the two of you home (ph); he's also kind of figuring out how it works to have Trae be with someone else. [00:17:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And he'll probably be the one usually doing—dropping off at daycare and picking up cause he usually has the car. Figuring all that out together, I think, has been helpful, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How's Trae doing with the drop-offs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's been fine. That's what I think is the funniest part of all of this. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's real flexible. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs) and fine. And even this morning when I was saying goodbye to him, and my mom had his hand and was kind of waving to me and he was just smiling. It's so nice that he hasn't had any trouble with it -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: at all. And when I picked him up on Wednesday from the daycare, I was coming up to the door and I could hear a baby crying outside and I didn't think it was Trae, but I was thinking, "Oh, I really hope it's not Trae," cause if I open the door and see him crying I would feel like that would be in my head—like, of him crying at daycare. [00:18:01]</p>

<p>And he was just on the floor, playing and laughing, when I opened the door. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was nice; and they just like love him there too, which is really cute. I know that he does cry there and that's okay; I'm sure he had his moments, but it's nice that he seems really happy there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Happy talks right now. (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's how he lets people know if he's hungry and he needs a bottle.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So I think it's good. He has his little way of communicating. Um, but I feel like that part has been really good. And just knowing that when he's home with our moms too, that it's nice for both sides.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, real familiar.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's loving it and I think they're really enjoying the time with him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. They're getting to develop a really special relationship.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really different to have grandparents that are so hands-on and involved. It's probably great for them and great for him -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and great for you guys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's nice to like talk to our moms too. They're figuring him out in their own way too—sort of get tips from them. Like when my mom got him down for a nap the other day, I'm like, "So what did you do? Are we doing the same thing? Like do you have any advice?" [00:19:05]</p>

<p>And even with daycare too it's—you feel like you know your own baby so well, and then when other people are figuring him out and getting to know him too, it's kind of nice to be collaborating and figuring out strategies. So that's been fun too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. They'd be a good resource for you, all three parties.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm, (pause for .03 seconds) yeah. So I do feel like, in general, I feel like it's going well. I definitely feel like I have my moments of just like—I think when it's also that I'm feeling extra tired.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has your sleep been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's been okay, like there have been a couple nights that I've had trouble, but again it hasn't been like that worry—that one worry that's on my mind that's keeping me up, which has felt good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's nice to know you don't have that burden.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and some of it, like I think, there was one night—now they're all kind of blending together—but that I just knew that I'd done -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of that having them blend together is actually a nice signal to us that there's not this thing that's standing out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If something was really bothering you, it would stand out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we can use the fact that they kind of blend together as feedback that (pause for .02 seconds) there's not something big -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: that's going on that's getting in your way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause for .02 seconds) and I think I knew that one night—it must have been Wednesday night preparing for a class on Thursday, cause I was doing work after—and so I was thinking about when we talked last time. Your body is on adrenaline to try and like finish it, so to just give myself more time to decompress and go to sleep.</p>

<p>So I feel like that's another big reason why I want to get work done at school and not have to bring it home. It's two-fold: I want to get home and spend time with Trae but then I also don't want to do it once he's in bed cause then I know that I'm going to be up and thinking about all that stuff. [00:21:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You don't want to start that churning then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (pause for .03 seconds) and then the other night—maybe two nights ago—I think I just had a lot on my mind in terms of school, but I was able to go to sleep. Then he woke up but got himself back to sleep, but I think I was just so awake and alert that I had a lot of trouble falling back to sleep. I think I was anticipating him needing me and he didn't. (laughs) He was fine.</p>

<p>So I think that, like—but again I remember talking with other moms and they say the same things. So those kinds of things -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feel very right or wrong? (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it feels okay that I'm up and then I woke up that morning and I was extra-tired cause I kind of lost an hour of sleep in between. But it was tired for a reason that I knew was probably pretty normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It was not your anxiety keeping you up. This was—your baby woke up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. So that again, that feels reassuring. On those days when I am feeling tired, I'm like, "Well, this is tired for a good reason." (laughs) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. This is tired for a normal, normal reason that is -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: totally appropriate, not a return to that kind of scary semester you had —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: that knocked you for a loop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. (pause for .03 seconds) But on those days when I do feel like I'm dragging, I feel like that's when I feel like, sometimes it just doesn't feel sustainable. I feel so tired, it's so much work to then come to school. Like—how do you keep this up?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it might not be forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This might be what it's like right now -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: but it doesn't need to be this exact same thing that's sustainable forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be—this might be the phase for now, what it's like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might even be a semester of this, who knows?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not going to be exactly like it is now forever.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And making sure that you keep your timeframe short, because so much does change so quickly—both in the academic world cause one semester's stresses might be different, or one part of the semester to another might be different—[00:23:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: and in the world of Trae, things are going to change pretty quickly too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: His needs now are not going to be the same six weeks from now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even with pumping. It mean it's like—you figured—having the office and having that schlep from one place to the other cut down will probably ease your burden during the day.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As he gets older, you're going to be doing fewer pumping sessions. And at some point, you're not going to be pumping at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So those kinds of things are pretty transitory.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not to let the worry be compounded by this sort of imaginary length of time -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: that you're going to be doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm. (pause for .02 seconds) Yeah, I think that's definitely too—and it's probably very related to me projecting in the future of worries that haven't come up yet. It is both kind of future-oriented where I do just need to focus on today. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and I think keeping that in mind—like, just even thinking back to two months ago, how much you got up at night. [00:24:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that be sustainable forever? No. Was it sustainable for how ever many months you needed to do it because that was his pattern? Yes. You got through that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such a huge difference from the beginning when you were waking up every two hours, or when it took you an hour to nurse. You'd be waking up every two hours but for an hour you were awake in between.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Such a difference from what nursing is now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it was—I just ruined (ph) my friend who had her baby three weeks ago. She was in the lactation room with me—I hadn't even met him yet—and that was kind of a reminder cause she was asking all these questions and I was like, "Wow. We definitely have come a long way from that." </p>

<p>Now Todd and I have all these new things with him that we're figuring out. But it's nice to know that —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But look what you did figure out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've already had these different set of challenges.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think just sometimes just step back and look at all of the challenges that you've come through, and all of the things that you've managed—that you didn't know how you were going to do before.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause for .03 seconds) Yeah, I mean that's pretty cool. Just to think of how much you learn—like he's only five months old, almost six months old this weekend which I just can't even believe—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that's crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: but I think of all that you have learned in six months. It's pretty crazy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um hmm, yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) A pretty steep learning curve.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Definitely, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you've done a great job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Want to take some time for relaxation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other things that we should cover before that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think that's everything. It was just that idea of feeling ups and down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know that that's normal, but there are times when I'm like, "We can figure this out," and other times when -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's harder to remember that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) Let's check our scheduling and then do some relaxation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh and I'll remember to grab a check from you today before. I forgot to—[00:26:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: so you don't have to shift into that mode after -</p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually already even wrote it out so I didn't forget.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause from [00:25:10] to [00:26:15) And so I have us for, in two weeks, on the 2nd at the same time—so we're okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, great. And then that will work cause then it's the same every other -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Every other—</p>

<p>CLIENT: so we got on the same kind of track.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right cause you had another meeting or something I recall.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. We're leading a little workshop series for other aides, to kind of get them comfortable in leading discussion sections and stuff like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh that's insightful (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>Relaxation session from [00:26:44] to [00:34:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you, good for your body.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's nice cause I feel like Tuesdays are a busy day too so it's nice that—[00:35:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To have this little space for a time out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's something I know you were thinking about. You said you were trying to be efficient with your time—you can use your pumping time for something like this too.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you might not be able to do all of the movements that we do, but you can certainly take deep breaths.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just think about letting your body relax, you know, taking that as a time out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've noticed that even if I'm extra tense pumping sometimes I feel like I won't produce as much as milk too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I try and make sure -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible from [00:35:35] to [00:35:38) as both are talking at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a good idea. Usually I just try to take some breaths or something, but that's a good idea to try it even more.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that could certainly help you to kind of shift modes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let your body relax and do its thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I'll see you in a few weeks.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good, okay. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're very welcome. [00:35:56]</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is always so weird trying to figure out what to talk about. (laughs) This is very hard for me to talk about myself like, ya know, a couple hours a week, ya know? But, I went home...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has it been as tough in here? Like I remember you told me...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It still is, yeah. I have to force myself to do it. I get myself into a mindset for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. So it's still, uh, very tough...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes it's because of the fact that I don't really feel like there's anything immediately to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really know what it is. So, I mean there's times like when okay, so I have something I need to talk about. But most of the time it's just the getting in the gear of talking about somebody besides myself. Especially Tuesday afternoons since I've been so focused on other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so...you would think that the hour long commute back would like fix that, but no, so (pause), But, um, yeah so um, I went home. It was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, of course (chuckles) um, I'm a worrier. I'm an only child. Ya know, my parents are getting up there and so like oh my God. They were like...they don't have a doorknob on the front door and this and that, and so I'm like (pause) I have lots of worries about them and things like that. Not so much immediately now but like as in later, ya know? But, that's, um...it's not entirely unfounded. I come from a family that doesn't really understand boundaries when it comes to work and overdoing it, and so I've got very valid reasons to be worried about them, ya know. My dad was up at 4:30, 5:00 a.m. like the whole time I was there, ya know getting work done and that kind of stuff. So it's not like it's (pause) for no good reason...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh [00:02:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, but I just...like I said I'm concerned about them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause). But there's not anything I can do about it so all I can do is tell 'em my opinion and hope they take it to heart and sort of let go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And worry, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And worry a little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause) but (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do they also worry about you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm sure they do. They do. They just, um...I don't think they...in fact I know for a fact I've gone out of my way to make sure that they do not know a whole lot about what's going on with me. I mean I talk to them all the time. They don't know that I'm depressed. They don't...they know nothing about Mike's problems. They know that Mike has problems with depression, but they don't know anything about that kind of stuff. They know his family is crazy. They don't understand how crazy, ya know? It's better that way because it's something that they can't conceptualize. Like they don't understand that and so what happens is it becomes asking lots and lots of questions. And I've done this before of talking to them about my problems and they'll just think that I'm coming to ask them for advice. And like I'm not asking for advice. There's nothing that you can do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:03:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? And so I pretty much don't. Plus my dad worries too much as is, ya know, about life, so he doesn't need to worry about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ya know, my mom is like have you thought about this? Have you thought about that? And like mom I assure you, you raised me, I've thought of every angle...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and every backup and even if this thing has changed, trust me, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not...and so it's not like I'm going out of my way to lie to them per se as much as, um, just not telling them what's going on? Because it's just something that would bother them anyways?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. They know I'm not thrilled with being up here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, they (pause) almost believe me when I tell them that we're not moving back, ya know. And so, um, I don't know. So. It's, it can be kind of rough, ya know. Cuz they are getting older. Um, my dad still thinks he fully intends never to truly retire, so...and that's just...it's very common with accountants.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh [00:04:48]</p>

<p>CLIENT: They just...I mean you just start being more selective in terms of your clients. Who you will and will not take. He never...I mean that just means you only bill 40 hours a week...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...as a retirement job.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That's part time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's part time. Billing. Billing isn't the same thing as actual doing either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughs) But, um, yeah it's unfortunately kind of normal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. I went back to my old store. I got to see a couple of people I really miss, which was good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, one of them wants to come work up here potentially and so I'm going to see what I can do to get him a position up in Salem. That was kinda nice. It was nice to have people recognize me who worked for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Went to visit some friends, ya know. Saw campus. That kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. But you got to go to carnival, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, carnival. Mm hmm. That's when I do all the whole buggy things and robots...basically it's more or less showcase...they build a lot of stuff some of which are not really engineering feats as much as can you believe this was made with plywood and it's actually kind of safe? But, um, it's basically, it's a lot of construction of stuff. Whether it be robots, whether it be, um, um, ya know. When I say the word buggy, I'm going to bring a picture up because it's very hard for people to understand this. Um, they're very small vehicles that actually have human beings in them that are usually...these days they do it, um, it's usually like made of, um, like fiberglass - single crystal cast fiberglassâ€”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but they're very, very aerodynamic. I'm gonna find some pictures here of them. Yeah! There's a human being in that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's a side thing from it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it? [00:06:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's something...well it's a, um...it's basically more or less kind of like a soap box derby but it's done at a much more extreme level. There's an area that has like this curve and a round part to it and it's pushed up a hill for part of it. It only makes right turns - I mean that's a human being in there like steering. That's why short women are very, very prized at the university.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But yeah, that's kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's weird that they have like all this tech stuff like showing it up there because like the top 10 boards because for years this was the top 10 boards. Now they have like this digital thing so you can see how the leaders are doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:07:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it's kinda weird. But, um, yeah, that's one of the big things is buggy. Um, just sorta like Nascar slash soap box derby.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's done on a level that is completely insane. Like usually there's a vacuum. You mainly make these things as it's made with vacuum and fiberglass and it's all made as one big piece. It's one crystal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's really...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's super aerodynamic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Super aerodynamic. Super light cuz you have to have pushing teams for it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:08:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It has to make a...it has to make a hairpin turn. It only...they only can...they can only turn right. It's, it's not possible to do anything else. There's no left turns in the whole thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But they have this hairpin turn which is well known for like crashing out on it and all that stuff, so it's kind of a big deal for there. So the um...so it was nice to...I didn't make it for any of the buggy except for the final trials. It starts at like five in the morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because they have to shut down streets. It's sort of insane. So, there's that kind of stuff. And visited some friends and that kind of thing. So it was nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Sounds like it was really nice. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Mike got to meet with some of his advisors and all the people...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...he really respects their opinion, and that's good. He may have a collaboration going where maybe he can go home every few weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We'll see. I'm pushing towards this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:09:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, whether or not it's paid for doesn't matter to me. It's just like an excuse to be there so that it's not time off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Does that make sense? It's like working there for, ya know, a week every so often, which would be nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...really that's the fairly really big things that are going on. Um, we did that. We drove back. It's been sort of sleeping and just sort of recovering. Um (pause) that's pretty much...sorting through my old stuff. Every time I go there I go through a little bit more of it and it's really hard for me cuz it's like a lot of things I want to toss. Some things I don't. It just...I can't believe that I have accumulated so many things over my life (chuckles). Most of it's back there. So, ya know. But, um, that kind of thing. Yeah. But, there's like I said it's been kinda stressful but. Mike really likes my parents but after a while they drive him up the wall. They drive me up the wall after a while too. They have just very different lifestyles. They like...they like more noise than we do. Which is probably the nicest understatement of the year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles) [00:10:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um...like I quite literally...and this is part of...I don't know how to explain this. I have what has been discussed as a very, very mild amount of attention deficit disorder. I have got ritualistic things in place so that it doesn't even matter any more. But like as a kid hearing the TV and trying to do homework at the same timeâ€”can't do that. I actually can't drive and listen - I almost never drive any more - but I can't drive and listen to the radio if it's like a talk show or anything like that at the same time either. I cannot have multiple forms of input. It's very difficult for me. And so although I wasn't doing any tasks where I had to, it still reminded me of the fact that I'm hearing all this stuff going on all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Not necessarily ADD actually. Um, sometimes people who have ADD actually do better when they have multiple things going on at once. Anyway...[ 00:11:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was specifically told at one point that I might have. Because I don't have hyperactivity and because I'm intelligent and a female it possibly was not actually ever diagnosed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sometimes that stuff gets missed, especially as you say like sort of quote like spacey girl, ADD sometimes get missed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not as much as spacey as much as just like, ya know...I was very good at faking like being attentive when I wasn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I guess sometimes with multiple input sources it's just more than I can handle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And actually it depends on what it is. Um, I still get that way if I'm in like a Wal-Mart when it's crazy. I can...if there's just too much stuff going on it really does. But for the most part I like have these ritualistic things where okay so it's time for me to do...and, and in school I did this. Like I probably didn't actually have to wear my glasses, but I was wearing my glasses when it was time to focus. Ya know. I'd sit down. I'd have like everything in front of me. I had enough pencil and paper. And it was very ritualistic, so this is the time for me to do this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:12:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And even now with certain things I will do that for anything else that's very detailed oriented. Which is very little of my life. But there are a few things that have to be very specifically, and so I have ways that I make sure that I'm prepared for that, ya know? But my parents' house is noisier than that. First of all they've got two enormous dogs who...one of which who every time a hair falls in his face like literally thinks something else is happening. It's really dumb. But, ya know, just in general the house is noisier than us, um, which is kind of, ya know, hard to handle. My parents are also just talkers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They want to talk. They don't ever like to have quiet silence that much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, um, it bothers me a little bit. It drives Mike up the wall. Like the fact that they're like oh, so, so what ya doing? He's like I'm working right now. Do you see I'm in front of the laptop? I've got like, ya know...this is actually like (inaudible at 00:13:28) and sarcastic thing to me. He's like I got (inaudible at 00:13:31) in front of me. It looks like I'm workin'. I'm workin.'</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles) [00:13:32]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's like yeah, I'm not like...ya know she'll just ask about things, cuz she's just...like she shouldn't walk by him without making conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's a guest, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that kind of stuff really drives him crazy, um, and so I think he was...we went home a day early and I think he was really happy for that. Not a day early, only like 12 hours early.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, um, so we did that and just got a lot of things accomplished that I was really pleased with. Not as much as I'd hoped but got a lot more accomplished than I thought I was going to. Which is good. Um (pause) so that was definitely helpful. Um (sighs). It's just definitely interesting to remember how different my life used to be, ya know? Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What d'ya have in mind? [00:14:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, just, just, ya know, being confronted with all the things that I have and did have. I'm very much into not owning anything more than I can...I mean at this point right now it's still taking forever to pack and move things, and I feel like I still have a lot of stuff. But boy I own a lot more stuff than that from like my life previously, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And how much I don't see...like don't want to waste things. I'd rather repair than rebuy or, ya know, do something to put it back, that kind of thing. And so, um, like I said it's a very different world, um, ya know, in terms of that. Um, I don't know. I just (pause) lighter, happier, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) How much do you miss it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It depends. I mean I miss it a little bit. But when I was living there...so like I was living in Cincinnati not at my parents' house it was still different</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And more like being, ya know, confronted with all the stuff from my teenage years...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and probably the twenties, things like that. My life is never gonna be like that again, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:15:54]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Not, like I said a lot lighter, a lot happier. So. Um (pause) I think that they were pretty distressed at seeing how hard it was for me to get around sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it's really upsetting to them that they can't do a thing about it. So (pause) my dog was really happy to be there. The dog thinks my parents are the best thing in the world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what they do when I'm not around but I'm sure she eats steak or something...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I don't know. But um, but she was pretty thrilled, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to be there but it's just (pause) (sighs)...it took me a while to really want to go out and about and face the world while I was there, though? I really wanted to stay in the house. I don't really know why. Maybe it was because of the fact I didn't want to be kinda down and then run into people I know like I had...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...ya know to go out to get some things fixed and all the stuff and I didn't want to kind of be around, like be kinda like in a bad place when that happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it took me a while to really feel comfortable doing that, which is hard to explain, but yeah, I sort of had to get decompressed before I felt comfortable doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um (pause) I don't know. I guess I was just kind of (pause) having a spell (inaudible at 00:17:46) for a little bit. I would never be that way any more, though, cuz I will never be, ya know, 19 any more or, ya know, 22 any more or anything like that but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You just seemed lighter and happier?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you're happier. Just in general younger, having more energy, more anything, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:18:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Life is less complicated, healthier, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I in general spend a lot of time wishing that I were younger, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. It is sort of, uh, goes with the...I am surrounded by people who are much younger than me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who are usually not just healthier, but younger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, younger. Definitely younger. Yeah. I don't even like to think about how old I am right now. I was telling my husband the other day that basically that, ya know, coming up on this next birthday is actually older than I ever imagined myself to be. Ever. And so not like as in like I thought my life would just cut off or like I'd die or something like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. When you pictured yourself you were younger, as old as you will be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yup. So, it's kind of a weird thing but (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What is it you don't like about older. Is it the responsibility? Is it...I mean I know that you said you don't feel as light or as happy about things but I imagine that's not just age. That's some things about your circumstances as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's energy. It's...ya know, it's everything. It's attractiveness. It's, ya know, it's everything. I mean (sighs) (pause) I remember turning I think it was like 20 or something like that and thinking to myself pretty much that there wasn't any, ya know basically there wasn't anything that I wanted or could achieve that could really be any better than this and so I just didn't want to get any...I mean I was like this well long time I never wanted to get any older. I started seeing like the dermatologist at like 22.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I've always been like that. It's physical. It's (pause) everything. And so, um, yeah (pause). It's sort of a weird thing but it's part of who I am. I just don't like being older.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being old. Feeling old. And, um, (pause) it's not that I really...it's hard to explain because I'm not entirely certain if I want to be young, like young now, as much as I wish that things would just be different, like they used to be I guess. So I really don't want to spend a whole lot of time on Facebook or like other things that are very popular now even...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so much, but like I think I'm probably the only person in the entire world who feels like I misspent my youth by spending all this time like in academia and not having a good time, ya know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You wish you'd been less studious and more hedonistic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A little bit, or at least more adventurous, so (pause)...back when, ya know, I felt like that, ya know. And, um (pause) I...I always thought that there would be time for that kind of stuff and then by the time that there was, it, ya know, not so much, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, if it wasn't for your health and like changing your work and stuff there probably would have been more time for that, right? [00:22:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably. I think so. I mean there's lots of times that have sort of gotten away, ya know? (pause) The thing that's even weirder is that I was...I think that part of the reason why I feel so much regret is because of the fact that I did actually have a lot of fun and a lot of good times but like I guess I've always been expecting more. We were having dinner with some friends of ours that we knew in graduate school and we were just telling stories about undergraduate and they were like well, I don't have stories like that. I have no stories like, ya know. I have exactly zero stories like that, ya know, and things like that, but I guess it's cuz of the fact that I had such a high expectation of things, ya know, that (pause) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, like what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh gosh. Um (pause) there's just (pause) there's just a million just little things from day to day that just were very amusing, um, that, ya know, some people I knew and, ya know, things we did. Things like that But I really felt like I was putting off a lot of things to go...like to be able to go out and do stuff as much as...like the time that we...we did some really silly things but nothing like, specifically like oh, this is an adventure when we did that, so I don't know. Well, that's not entirely true. Maybe I just have like irrational expectations as to what my life could be like in my twenties and thirties cuz I had way too much fun while still studying and I just figured there was going to be more than that. I don't know. But, um, ya know it's (sighs) (pause)...but like I said we just had sort of, like you said irrational expectations in terms of that I guess. I don't know. (pause) We built a lot of just contraptions and...I mean it still was very studious type of stuff but we built a lot of contraptions and we did a lot of really dumb ass stuff like duct taping one of our friends to the ceiling. This was totally consensual.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, just other ridiculous things that were just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You duct taped your friend to the ceiling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For how long was he or she on the ceiling?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, a couple of hours. It...I'm not exactly...I wasn't...I wasn't party to why this was happening. I was only happened after the fact.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yes. That kind of thing. Or just, ya know, stupid stuff. Um, but the...and of course now that I'm trying to think of anything I can't think of anything like outstandingly fabulous off the top of my head but there was just (pause), ya know, stuff. It, it tech schools often have a history of pranks...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:25:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of thing. So, um, the people in...the people in my dorm decided single handedly that we were going to steal the entire amount of silverware it had but we were doing it like one and two meals at a time and then we delivered them all back on the last day of classes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But we did eventually single handedly have all the silverware. That kind of stuff. Um, ya know, stripping down monitors and dropping them to watch them implode. Back of the monitors were actually going to (inaudible at 00:26:16). So you know all that stuff, ya know. But (pause) and I'm not really looking for that really as much as just, ya know (pause)...it is weird to be confronted with the fact that I was considered to be sort of a legend. People I never met in my life knew who I was...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and sort of like knew me as being, ya know, being cool and like smart and all this other stuff. It was very weird to be a very different person from that and being confronted with the well, there's Debra stories, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm. Were there particular things you were legendary for? [00:26:58]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, well I was voted into office at a university I didn't attend, or a college I didn't attend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles). Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I got...somehow got in as a student representative at the College of Law, which is separate from the university, the, the Institute of Science. They have all these different schools...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, because people saw me around there so often. Just stuff. Um (pause) like I said just...things just happened. People just knew I was just this, ya know, usually the instigator of everything that was stupid and bad and in general not something you should be doing. That kind of thing. Not bad like that but like, ya know, um, there would often be things like gravity testing regularly to make sure the gravity was still there. Just you know various things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like were there various things you gravity tested?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, there were all kinds of things. Usually things that when filmed would be, ya know, interesting. Like things imploding or things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that were, ya know...it's regularly known that they had dropped, ya know, all kinds of stuff cuz it sparks or it does this or it does that. Ya know that kind of stuff. Or I just...I mean it was always something. It was always something weird that we were doing. Something with liquid nitrogen. Something with...that we...you know that we probably shouldn't have done and so it just I...although about 80 percent of the things that are attributed to me being involved in, probably I have nothing really to do with somehow. Or I had something to do with it but I wasn't really the person who decided to do it. Like it just, it just sort of (pause) ya know sort of became sort of a legendary thing for that and so it's weird to be different than that, ya know? Um, so...it's it's...ya know I can't think of anything off the top of my head but usually it was just hilarious things involving ya know. Like I got everybody in my dorm to go on Tuesday nights to one this place in bathrobes. We would always dress up in bathrobes so we could look like escaped mental patients in our head.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz you know mental patients really do walk around in bathrobes really.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, and we'd all troop down there together to do this, or you know that kind of stuff. We were just like...and yes maybe I had a lot to do with it but for some reason I was the person who always got attributed as the person for things like that, and so. There was never anything really truly bad...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sort of prankster type.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Nothing that anybody ever got hurt with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I had nothing to do with the duct tape because I'm not really sure exactly what that was about but it was funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? Um, that kind of stuff, ya know? And so, and so it's weird not to be like that any more too much, ya know? I don't even know where to start. I mean that was just second nature to me. I'd be like so I wonder what's inside of this thing, ya know, or let's figure this out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know, or I don't know. Something...it used to be so second nature to me to be like that that I really felt like when I was on campus I was becoming who I was and now I'm not so much like that and it's just...I miss it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I bet. [00:30:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Someday you have to grow...at some point you had to grow up and be like okay so ya know like. Oh yes. There we go. Um, when something was supposed to be destroyed that was not totally. Something had to be destroyed so it wasn't unrecognizable and it was made...it was a metal chassis of magnesium and like, oh yeah. You didn't specify how it had to be destroyed. Magnesium is a...magnesium is a type of metal that you can light on fire. This actually...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Doesn't it get really, really hot when you light it on fire?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. With a very bright white light that you can't even look at.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like it well it was, it was like why does it have to be destroyed? Okay, well I'm going to take it down and we're gonna light it on fire in the parking lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh (chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And sure, we were supposed to destroy it. Magnesium also bends really easily so you could have easily just taken a vice to it and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That would be a little more obvious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But it was based...a lot of the times when you build certain types of things, um, like internal chass...actually, um, your laptop version a couple before that had magnesium on the inside. As light.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean, to get it to catch fire you have to be like 1100, 1200 degrees so you actually really have to like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like use a blowtorch or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) Arc welding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, plasma type...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but yeah. So, ya know, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you got it to work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We had a laboratory of stuff, ya know. We're told...I mean this is for a job. They said destroy this and like okay. So, we did. You didn't specify how you needed it to be destroyed, so ya know. Um, and so it's just, um...I mean at some point you had to grow up and stop like lighting things on fire but not that I ever really had a deep need to light things on fire.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just seems like things always happened that way. Or realizing that the commercial dishwasher is good for cleaning everything, um, that was great. There's a thing called a Hobart that's a giant commercial dish...you just put things in here, water comes down. It's what they use for commercial dishwashing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [00:32:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: You realize that just about everything that was dirty if you put it in and you put through the Hobart and it came back out it was clean. I was the one that came up with that idea.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What sorts of things did you...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like anything that was dirty at all. Like anything plastic or anything that like could be exposed to water. Just put it in there. Cat box.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, oh gosh, we put all kinds of...like I came up with like a big wheel. You just shoved it in there. You can it and came back out it was clean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? Um, so (pause) and ya know I think I told you the story about the only time I ever got into a bar fight. Not bar fight, but a party fight in which I hit a professional sportsman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's probably part of the reason why I was legendary in that (inaudible whispering at 00:33:45).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ya know it's just I...I liked being kind of cocky, ya know? I, ya know, had my barrage of snarky I'm-better-than-you-are T-shirts that said like I heart math on them, and I, ya know, had a slide rule that I barely knew how to use but I could use better than just about anybody else so therefore it sounded, ya know, like I was a lot better than I really was, and I was cool and I was smart and, ya know, and we...I don't know. I kind of miss it. I was very arrogant, extremely arrogant and it was kind of...because I had the goods to back it up, (inaudible at 00:34:30) respected me, ya know? (pause) It was kinda nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds pretty great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah, if you're living like the...the...if you're living like in the movie "Real Genius" maybe but in the real world it doesn't always work that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that was college. I'm not so sure that was the real world.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, but sometimes I miss it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:34:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that that many people actually have those kind of experiences, though. Some people do but not everybody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I think you're right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ya know it's...but I kinda miss that kind of stuff and so I feel really embarr...at the time I'm also wanting to be perpetually young I also feel embarrassed for being immature, which is even weirder I know. I just want to basically be able to pause my body at a certain age and still be older in my head I think. Because I don't want to be immature enough to wish that, ya know, I was still in college or to like, ya know to be so shallow as to think that things are important, so (pause) I just, um...when you don't have a whole lot of other things going on in your lifeâ€”I mean I have a lot going on but not like it's fulfilling.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You sort of fall back on the things that were really great and so it's really hard to be telling stories that, ya know, things that happened back in 1998. I mean it's starting to really stretch this like, ya know, time and period of time, ya know. Or, ya know, a time period of doing things, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:36:10) the statute of limitations on feeling good about yourself and like more excited about your life, ya know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess so. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There is nothing that's really, um, (inaudible at 00:36:43) time for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) It was. Funny thing is, is that, the other thing is that there was a time when back when, ya knowâ€”he wasn't my husband back then but my boyfriend was fairly normal, ya know? He was my co-conspirator in most things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, oh it depends on what it was, but usually I mean he tolerated it, but he was a happier guy, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He was definitely, um, ya know, up for anything, more social, able to ya know handle that kind of stuff, ya know? And so, um, able to deal with things that were not the same as his own way of thinking too, ya know? Um, I think both of us have gotten pretty closed-minded on that kind of stuff in general. Like sometimes I just like oh my God, I just can't handle this. I just don't want to be around people who honestly believe in like the Gia theory of earth being one big organism. Like that kind of is how sophomoric is that. But like for the most part, though, it's (sighs) ya know, it was a good time in our lives, ya know. He used to brag about the fact that his girlfriend, ya know, impressed the guys in the group not only with her ability to calculate but with the ability to drink. Ya know that kind of stuff. I'm like, the group for instance had people that...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that a company? [00:38:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, no, no, no it's the...basically it's the people that...is that's the joint project group of people that do like research and testing and that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're associated with the Tech. They're the NASA part of the Tech.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, the group Laboratory.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Gotcha. I mean I've heard of that, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah they're a very heavy drinking group. In fact, everything about Tech that I have been involved with unfortunately has been a whole lot of heavy drinking. It's the number one reason why I didn't go. (inaudible at 00:38:51) bribed but I think I realized that, um, people were having too much fun there, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was what you were deciding between there and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I was actually...I actually, um, accepted. I changed at the last minute to go back to Brown. I did early calculus out there, um, so...I just, ya know, after having been out in...after being out West and I realized how amazingly party the atmosphere was and how about half of the people I met weren't actually students. They were there but they were not enrolled. There was like this huge like washout rate of people who were still having a good time and spending all this time on campus but had already failed out or they were on academic probation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It made me feel like maybe this was going to be a little too much of a good time, so...but yeah that group came out every year to do some stuff and, um, ya know, at the time it was doing lots of stuff related to that, so it was pretty cool. Um, ya know just he was proud of that, ya know. And it's not like he's not proud of me now but it was definitely...I was a much cooler...I was a much cooler accessory to people's lives than, ya know...ya know and at the time it still was a little bit (inaudible at 00:40:21) definitely at the time. If you didn't want to go somewhere, I always had a date. Didn't bother me. And he understood that like it wasn't romantic but I never had a problem with finding someone to take me to whatever it is that I wanted to do, and so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sounds like you were a total bad ass.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bad ass (whispered). And I miss that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, who wouldn't?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know? (pause) I miss that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:40:55]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yet some things have changed and some things are exactly the same there, which is, ya know...like there's this one dorm room that...there's this one dorm apparently which...we didn't actually talk to anybody but I could tell it was definitely that way. The card reader never really worked right because of the like where it was placed and so it was easier just to, just do one swift pull and pull the door open to yank it open than it was to actually legitimately use the card reader to get the door.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like that was that like back in like the 90's. It's still like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Ya know, that kind of stuff, and so, um, (inaudible 00:41:37) it was a good time in life, and so...I mean I'm not saying that I have to be like that all the time, but it was, ya know...I think that maybe that was sort of a big letdown for me, was the fact that my life hasn't been as cool as all that. I don't...I wasn't like this in high school by the way. I was never...I mean I had friends and things like but I was never that popular, ya know, and so it was sort of a big shock.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) yeah. It was a good time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um, I'm not saying it always has to be that way, ya know? But...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hear what you're sayin' it was great and you miss is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not that you have expectations that your life would always be like that or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...um, that you wouldn't grow up or anything like that. It's just that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was a...I think the big thing is it was so unexpected to have me feel so at home there and had become super popular and to have that kind of like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...legendary status, like not having ever in my life, that it was (pause) it was nice. And that happened a little bit, ya know, in different places I worked too. I mean there's things that...it was a lot more conservative on that level.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it was, ya know...it definitely was, ya know, on some level the people ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was still pretty cool for a long time. Now I'm this babbling idiot that, ya know, sometimes fixes people's phones, so...I think that's part of the reason why I've sort of had to embrace the weird now at my workplace cuz it's about the only thing exciting that ever really happens, ya know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? [00:43:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, ya know embracing the strange things that occasionally happen at work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just sort of hold on to those things cuz it's like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: There isn't really anything else exciting in my life. I mean I help little old ladies book trips to Vegas, ya know, for the most part. So when you do get the person who like (sighs) does something completely absurd to their phone and they're trying to figure out, trying to figure out if it's possible to be considered under warranty, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's a gem, so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We're gonna stop for now, um, but we'll talk more on Thursday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good. If you start to have a regular opening on Thursday afternoons I would like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be better? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, summer's easier for me in terms of my joints but also just, I just want to try and plan for the future in general.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Um, don't know of anything opening up imminently now but I will...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm sort of keeping that ahead so that when come October if something comes...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. Yeah that'd be good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Plan ahead.</p>

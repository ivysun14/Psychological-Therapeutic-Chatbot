<p>PATIENT:  (6-minute silence) When I first came in I was, uhm, beginning to think about 1 or 2 things that occurred to me yesterday, after I left.  And then I just seemed almost to forget I was here and, and at least I wasn't thinking about what am I going to say.  And I began to think about 1 or 2 things that, uhm, well, I, I told mscz what had happened when I went to the gallery yesterday and, and his reaction was the same as mine on why the man was pushing the painting he was.  And then today, another thing that had bothered me yesterday, uhm, was the need to help the teachers who have been missing their assistant.  And, uhm, I went over to help them today and they had already left.  So I felt sort of justified in feeling a little annoyed at the noise they had made on how hardworking they were, although in a way that's still unfair.  But I be—, it was just, I was beginning to sort of accumulate all these things that proved to me somehow that I was right in the judgments I had made yesterday.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Mm.  Ah, you must have had the impression that I was disputing your judgment about the man, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, I think I did, yes.  That's what I was trying to say yesterday when, sort of in a roundabout way.  And I even did this yesterday.  Uhm, I don't recall now what was coming to my mind at the end of the time but I think I remember noticing after I left that it was, uhm, well, something that would make me feel better about myself.  It's almost as if for a while I tear myself down and go over all the things that make me feel awful about myself and then it, and then I have to start adding up things that I can feel, well, I'm not really that bad because I did this or this happened.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: One other piece of unfinished business from yesterday: ah, I'll have to let you know next week sometime about Tuesday definitely.  As of the moment, it doesn't seem as though it will be feasible but I want to make one other check and I won't be able to know until next week sometime.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Okay, thank you.  (Pause) I was thinking about, uhm, the reaction I had to your question yesterday on, uhm, or, or the comment and, and when I took it as a criticism of my reaction to the man when he was had talking to me about the different paintings.  And something I read last night also seemed to tie in.  It was a person talking about, uhm, an experience a teacher had when she was asked why she did something.  And she immediately had to fee—, felt she had to make up a reason because she didn't feel her reason was acceptable and how often it's easy to read in something in a question that isn't there.  And it made me realize that if I get a direct question on of, probably, just pure curiosity on somebody's part, I practically always assume it's sort of an implied criticism and I have to justify myself and so have to make things sound better than perhaps they would otherwise.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But the thing that occurred to me after I left yesterday, uhm, well, when I got home, I only thought about 1 thing.  And it was something I didn't mention yesterday.  And so then it seemed as if this were, probably was the thing that was bothering me most.  And because during the time yesterday I somehow felt that they were all things that had disturbed me but I was putting more weight on them than they really should have had.  Or when I talked about my annoyance with the man in the gallery, I was, I somehow felt that I was putting more intensity in it than, than — because I, I had just been sort of slightly annoyed while I was at the gallery.  At least, I only let myself feel slight annoyance.  And when I got home I began to think about, uhm, the fact that my assistant is looking at another school.  And I had known that a friend of hers has been after her to look at the school and consider going there.  But, uhm, she didn't, she implied to me she wasn't very interested.  And then I found out yesterday, through my supervisor, that she's quite interested in having class of her own.  And the thought hadn't really, I, I knew she might want it but she's been quite happy with not having responsibility so far and has often said she wouldn't want it.  And, ah, she doesn't have the qualifications yet for most schools to hire her so it just really hadn't occurred to me.  And I think I was feeling awfully guilty after I realized that she might very well get a job with a class of her own or at least, really want it for next year.  Because I think I've not always, but sometimes when I'm feeling competitive and, and therefore have to have great control over her, I felt secure in doing it because I felt she won't leave.  And so somehow it was very upsetting to me to think that maybe she really will be leaving next year.  And it was such a switch, too, after often enjoying feeling critical of her, to suddenly feel this way.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: This just didn't occur to you during the hour, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, it, well, I think at the beginning — well, I don't know if it did at all while I was here yesterday.  It didn't after the beginning.  I don't recall ever just feeling I'm, I can't talk about it.  But when I was home, I, I was just constantly going over and over, how can I suddenly be nice to her now so that she won't want to leave?  And in a way, it's, has nothing to do with that but that's always my first inclination.  I always take things in a very personal way.  And part of the reason that she wants her own class next year is that the person she's dating is going to be going into the service.  And so she's going to have a lot of time on her hands that she didn't have before.  And she'd just as soon have a job that's more demanding.  But I st—, even knowing that, I still take things in a very personal way and I felt guilt too because it seemed almost that she knows this, maybe unconsciously and that's why she couldn't talk to me more openly about it. (Silence)</p>

<p>And sometimes when I think about this, uhm, feeling of guilt that I have, I'll think of how I have treated her.  And on the whole, I haven't treated her that badly but I think it's because of the thoughts I've had.  And I, I don't know how much of them I've shown but just the fact that I've had the thoughts and, and that some of them have, in a way, nothing to do with her but, but I still have them about her, make me feel even more guilty.  Somehow it makes me think of, uhm, in a way, the way I reacted with the friend of mine when first I was very active in ostracizing her from a group of friends that we had.  And then, later on when she had made her own circle and when my circle had changed or they all mingled so that I was, again, in a group where she was and somehow I felt very much more vulnerable than she then, or weaker and very guilty about how I'd treated her.  So that I think I still feel guilt about her. (Pause)</p>

<p>The other thing that happened and, uhm, I don't always think it.  I don't know quite why I thought it last night but it's something that various occasions I have thought.  Uhm, I was riding up the escalator from the subway and every once in a while I feel very uneasy about the fact there's somebody behind me.  And this time there was somebody quite close and something they held brushed my leg.  And immediately the thought of somebody with a knife slashing my, the backs of my legs came into my mind and the fact that, if somebody were crazy enough and really wanted to do it, they could and I couldn't do anything about it.  And it made me think of, I don't know, there're just odd times when, for a minute, I'll suddenly feel very much overwhelmed by this feeling that I'm at the mercy of all these people around me, if they ever wanted to suddenly become vicious, they could and there'd be nothing I could do.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you have any particular images or, you know, pictures about the sort of person?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No.  Sometimes I don't even connect it with a person, really.  It's sort of, more just the feeling that, no matter how careful you are, accidents can happen to you.  Just like, you might be walking down the sidewalk and a car might suddenly get out of control and crash into you.  (Pause) I've only been aware fairly recently, I don't know how long, now that I think things sometimes in this way.  But I was just thinking now when I was saying that about no matter how careful you are, that this must be somehow connected with the way I suddenly changed, or at least it seemed to me as I recall my childhood, I suddenly changed from being fairly free about exploring different things and wanting to do different things to being extremely cautious and afraid.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I believe you said that was around the 3rd or 4th grade.  You were 9 or 10.  Or was it earlier than that?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't, I don't know, it might have been earlier.  (Pause) The one thing that I connect with it that always disturbed me, I think, happened when I was 9 or 10, 9 or 10.  But it might have happened, the feeling might have come much earlier.  Because I keep thinking of that, of diving one day and then just sort of crashing into the bottom.  At this point I'm not even sure how much of that actually happened.  But the image of it is very real.  And, and it was, the image is very frightening.  I mean now I know I'd have the control so that it wouldn't happen to me but the feeling of something frightening still is there with that memory.  I don't know, it's just sort of the feeling that the attitude I must have had and, and still do, that I wasn't strong enough, I didn't have the power to do anything.  (Pause) And after watching a boy in my class this year, who has accidents all the time, I began to wonder how much of this feeling came just from the fact I used to have accidents all the time until I would just doubt my ability to do anything without having something befall me and that in itself I should think would make me feel very cautious. (Silence)</p>

<p>I just began, because of a fact that these 2 boys were together, I jumped from this boy who I always having accidents to another boy in my class, the one who demands so much attention and, and was thinking of something that happened with him today.  And I, it was, uhm, regarding some puppets he has.  And because he brought his in once and did a very good job showing them, uhm, other boys have started bringing theirs in.  And now he's sort of upset because the limelight isn't on him any longer, alone with the puppets.  And I caught myself after thinking that, uhm, and just sort of being, well, remembering his face and, and being sort of amused that he was so open about his being upset, then I caught myself thinking, well, this isn't the kind of thing I should be thinking now.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Hmm?  Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  I don't know.  It just, I guess, because I felt, well, it doesn't have anything to do with me.  (Pause) And I think the reason I said, talked about it now is because of your question yesterday on did I separate things on what should be said here and what shouldn't and just not talking about the trip to ptn.  And it has also made me realize, lots of times when mscz's mentioned something he was talking about, I've been surprised because it seemed to me it wasn't something, if it had occurred to me, I would have talked about.  It's almost as if, as much as like yesterday I was protesting that all I was thinking of were depressing or pessimistic things but yet, on the other hand, it seems as if it's the things that are bothering that are the things I should be talking about.  I, it's in a way, the same thing I do when I'm alone.  Just sort of, I go over and over all the things that are disturbing me, then somehow I'll be able to figure things out and not be so disturbed by them.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: This little boy, eh, you were amused by his openness of his resentment?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, he, he sulks by putting on a face in a very conscious way.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Does it bring anything else to your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  The way I sulk.  (Laughs) I suppose that's why I was amused a little bit.  (Pause) In fact, he, I find him fairly easy to work with because he constantly is doing things that, I might be misjudging him, but always seem to me I'm reading him correctly because it's so much the way I — well, not that I'd react exactly the same way but enough so that I understand what he's, what his thinking is or what his emotions are.  And it always sort of amuses me so that I can give him the attention he needs and feel affectionate toward him.  And I don't, if I didn't feel this understanding, I don't think I could, because he's sort of an exhausting child to have around.  And of course, then that makes me wonder how exhausting I must have been.  When I see it that way, I can s—, I think, well, perhaps my mother gave me quite a bit but I was just asking for too much.  But when I think of my memories of my childhood completely unrelated to this boy and what I see him doing, my memory is that I didn't get anything.  And it would have been so easy for her to just give a little bit of the kind of affection I needed.  (5-minute silence)</p>

<p>I began to think of other little things that happened either today or things that we're going to do in the class that I feel enthusiastic about.  And, I don't know, all these thoughts were very positive and I just realized I'm, I find it very hard to say things like that.  (Silence) Somehow it's sort of connected with being able to say I like something, just committing myself.  If something pleased me, I think I'm, well, partly it'll tell something about me and maybe I'll be pleased for the wrong reason so I shouldn't risk letting on.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>Also I think, I'm, uhm, sort of aware of thinking that, well, in a few minutes the time will be up and almost hoping that it will be because otherwise I might say something I don't want to say.  But I'm not sure exactly what I might say, that I don't want to say.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, saved by the bell.  (Patient laughs) Time's up.</p>

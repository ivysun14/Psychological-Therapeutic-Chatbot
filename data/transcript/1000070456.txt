<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This is the eighth interview. This is the eighth interview.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Want some gum?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no, I'm not supposed to chew. I have a temporary, like a bridge (inaudible 0:22 for me I had it put it on last week, and I (inaudible at 026) Doughnut King, and I had to go to my dentist for a special trip, and he re-glued it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did you move?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh it's, I like the apartment. The first weekend I was lonely for my old place, but I really like it now. We still have the painting. I'm still haven't, I'm still deciding on the colors for the rooms, but it's comfortable. I have a good view of downtown from my kitchen window (inaudible at 1:04) especially. Like the back window, I get a better view than from the front, but I'm glad I moved. [1:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There aren't too many young kids in the building, Robert doesn't really like them, but the neighborhood has a lot of kids. There are little kids that Adrian can play with. So . . . I was thinking I wish I'd come more consistently in the past month where I could . . . but because I like, I think my head would have felt better. I've been going through these phases where I've really been really either mad at myself or other people or really happy just jumping back and forth even the past couple of days.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really going up and down like me. [2:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I feel like, that I've gotten worse as far as being able to control myself. I've been trying hard. Robert came in this past weekend. I've really been working at not letting a lot of things bother me and like I said, it's a real job. But I read this poem, it kept saying, "Don't think, think, think, think about things do, do, do." So I've been trying to follow it every time, so it can advise me to start thinking about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's bothering you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I, just . . .well just a lot of things, like I told you before, from the past. But surprisingly, I don't know . . .he's changed a lot. You know what I mean? And I guess because everybody's been telling me to be patient and just quit picking on things, so I've been okay. Like today, I was okay yesterday. Yesterday I was . . . I felt like I was regressing and losing myself. I think I'm going down as a person and even losing like my character and stability. [3:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just, I just, well I stole something about a month ago. It, it, it, like a little locket thing, and I did it because I didn't want to pay the money for it (inaudible at 3:35). And you know I felt bad about it for a while and, and I just started rationalizing like a big junk department store and being able to talk to a friend about it. It didn't make me feel any better because he said all women go through a phase of stealing. But I just, I just feel like a couple of years ago I never would have stolen anything. I just, I would have scorned somebody when it happened, and I have scorned myself for it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's different then? [4:13]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, like, like I say, I keep rationalizing in my mind that it's for my survival, self-survival, which is kind of stupid because I don't really need a locket, but I wanted it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 4:29) get into it</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it was, it was a real pretty locket. And I talked to my other friends, and they, I'm not doing it to, like, to forgive myself, but from what they tell me, they steal things left and right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even so it doesn't seem quite right to you</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's just they're saying it bothers me. I don't really ask about the objects and things with the idea they steal too. I mean, they're just real casual about it obviously.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's something you can't endorse and somehow (inaudible at 5:06) obviously. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I, half of me says, okay you don't nobody stopping to read about how all these companies make a lot of money. But again I just, I don't really like to steal. It's one of the things . that . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think changed inside you? Why do you do it, do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess . . . I don't know. I thought, I thought it might be like a game almost because all my friends were stealing. Maybe I didn't specifically want to follow them, but I guess I saw them doing it and I felt, oh, I should try it. I can have anything that I want . . . for free. But what I'm just going to do is get in trouble. [6:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 6:07)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know . . . just to see because I really wanted the thing too only I didn't want to pay money for it. And my younger sister does it too, and it doesn't bother her or anything</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about it now? Do you think you'll do it again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably not for a while. I might do it again. I think I might, but I don't go looking through the stores for something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think you really intend to do it again. I think it's pretty painful for you to talk (inaudible at 6:49).</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I think, I think, I don't know. I think I'd probably decide right at the store what I would do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Too hard to think about it without any pressure. [7:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not pressure. I just, like I used to like to do it. I mean in my mind, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like (inaudible at 7:08) store not like you really didn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, possibly. It was not like premeditated or something</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, that's how it was last time. I mean you just did it, but then you'd gone through what I interpret to be a lot of self-emotions about how you shouldn't have.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I, I think I wish I'd been . . . I wish I hadn't really wanted the locket because I haven't worn it since I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. That's what I thought.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what you thought? I really wanted jewelry. And I don't really . . . yeah, but you know it'd look crummy on a t-shirt or something. But I haven't worn it</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't feel quit right about that locket</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm probably remembering every time I put it on. [8:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it doesn't seem like thinking about it ahead or not makes much difference in how comfortably you're going to feel next time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. At least not for, at least not . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think it might be different next time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Possibly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes you uncomfortable. How many times did you do it before you decided it wasn't good for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this was the only time I did it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 8:29)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Next time you mean? What did you say again?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look, what I'm puzzled by is you say on the one hand that part of you wants to do it and part of you really doesn't approve, but you did it. And then since then you've been trying to justify over and over again to yourself and came away upset anyway because you feel so bad about it</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's not . . . I don't feel so bad about it. I just haven't worn the clothing, the clothes that I hardly have a chance to . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh, I see. [8:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I guess it (inaudible at 9:01) buy it, but I think if I did dress up with something like that, would go with it, probably would doubt it and would keep thinking that I stole it. I would think other people had thought . . . knew that I had stolen it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel bad, actually, whether you wear it or not. So what I was asking is, -how come if you know it makes you feel bad you would think about doing it again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I would think about doing it again if it was something that I needed or wanted. That I knew that I needed or wanted. (inaudible at 9:36)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just that this locket, you didn't really want it or not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I thought I did. At the store it was pretty, and then after I got it, I didn't really have much use for it</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that would happen with anything that you stole? That you'd get to feeling so bad about it that you've decided you didn't need or want it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. I'd, I would admire it in the store but not really have any use for it like maybe admire it, but you won't necessarily want to buy it or have to have it. [10:15]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Do you understand what I'm talking about? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see, if you do something that makes you unhappy . . . let's take another example, go ice skating. You hate it. So then afterwards you get to thinking about how painful it was and how you didn't like it and your ankles hurt and then you might say, well, I'm not going ice skating anymore, it makes me unhappy. Or you might say, well it's just that ice skating rink, that's what it was. Well, it's just that particular time you wish you hadn't gone, so you go ice skating with different shoes or go to a different place. Or maybe the second time you won't hate it as much as the first time</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm just trying to think maybe if it was a different object that I liked, that I knew I liked, I don't know. That's how I feel about it right now. I probably would still remember that I stole it, but I stole it (inaudible at 11:18). I'd probably keep it and use it or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why would you want to do something that makes you unhappy like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess just for the pleasure of whatever it was, I mean . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being more pleasure and having nothing, having the pleasure to make up for. Having the pleasure and having nothing to make up for the pain is so true, knowing that you took it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: True. I don't know. I'm kind of tying in, I think maybe the locket . . . I don't know. I think if it were another object, like something I liked a lot, I'd think something different. [12:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you would still feel bad about taking it though. You might enjoy it so much it would compensate for it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I might forget about it, I mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you wouldn't forget about it, you'd still feel bad about taking it</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, maybe I would each time I wore or used it. But maybe because I did like it so much, it wouldn't bother me so much afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think it's sort of like if you like something, you know, it'll make up for how bad you (inaudible at 12:46)? Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it sounds like it does to you, but really in my mind; you'd think it would . . . yeah, for me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A lot of times when you do that kind of thing, something that really makes you unhappy, there is something else about it that will make you happy enough to make up for it.[13:09]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I guess the only part where I' m confused, I guess, is that if something makes me unhappy I don't do it anymore. Whatever it is, doesn't matter what it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I'm confused or perverted.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't think it's perverted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I think I do it the same thing with people. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Keep trying to make something good out of something that's making you unhappy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or yeah, like it could have been worse or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And when you go back for more, it doesn't mean it does not hurt because it matters a lot. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I keep thinking it might get better. I don't know if that's (inaudible at 14:08). I keep asking for it, but I, I think I have a lot of faith in people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It (inaudible at 14:12) all the faith in the world. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not up to faith in the world. No. (chuckle)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sometimes you meet somebody who's better enough already you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if you think that you really love them. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you really like them just the way they are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well I'm sure there are some things though (inaudible at 14:45). I, I think I know one person like that, but I don't know them real well. Just casual contact, everything all . . .(inaudible at 14:56).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You knew him better you wouldn't feel like that anymore? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I, if I knew more about him I could tell if something might displease me, but from what I've seen so far, I think I might like the rest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you could sort of imagine going into a situation with someone where you just really liked them for who they were, and you didn't have to have a lot of faith hoping they change over a matter of time. But most of the time, it's not what you do. You go into situations that make you unhappy a lot of times hoping that they'll turn out differently. [15:41]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well with people, I don't really know that much about them, and maybe that . . . like they're in different moods or like they're . . . you know people pretend to put on when they first meet somebody. You know how they'll come on? And then after you get to know them, or when they're not acting, they show that their real selves.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then you find out if you like them or not</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah I guess it's uh . . . I don't know. The mood I'm in is good, like kind of put up with the changes and everything.</p>

<p>Like my own girlfriend last night. I constantly tell her that I'm still at a crossroads with my feelings about people. And she, she said well a lot of people are, she said, constantly changing from minutes to hours not changing in the sense of moods move back and forth, but she said there's no reason to feel bad about it.</p>

<p>(Knock on door)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Excuse me.</p>

<p>(Door opens; counselor speaks to someone in distance, door closes.)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Pretty much feels like everything is changing all the time. There's no real thing you can get at, whether you really like somebody or not, because you're a different personality kind and they're a different personality kind </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there are, like, a few people that I specifically know that I like because their reaction to something I say is constant. I can kind of tell. [18:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's what makes you upset with people. They always change.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, people that you know are sad or happy or crabby or demanding, they might react to . . . I don't know. I don't know exactly how I feel. I, it's a permanent . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like you prefer that they don't have any strong emotions that you have to react to. Seems like it's got less to do with changing that you just having a strong emotion to something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think in having the strong emotions is kind of changing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But (inaudible at 1856) feel crazy all the time, real sad all the time, real sad all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that would be someone who had a, like, one face that would kind of be like a person, a permanent personality change kind of. [19:19]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That doesn't bother you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, maybe, it's like I know that I'm confused. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's part of the problem with you is just not knowing what's going to happen if they're going to choose. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and not knowing how to react, or how I should react, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you feel like they're changing, and you can't be yourself. You have to try changing with them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not, I, maybe it's because I want to be friendly with them or be able to communicate with them and not lose them. [20:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonder what happens if you lose you . . . along the way? (inaudible at 20:14)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well when that happens I think I find the other person kind of reacts . . . well kind of makes me easier to see them because I think, I don't know, maybe they gain some kind of control or stability. This time he seems to be uh, he seems to be the more stable one. You know what I mean? Like nothing is really traumatic with him. Whereas before . . .I . . .he relied on me emotionally. And in a way, I guess maybe this was what I was hoping for all along having a stable person. I mean the majority, he'd be okay or something, but . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about him now that he's stable? [21:18]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think he's okay. It's not who. (inaudible at 21:20]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You like him still?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've become . . . I rely on him, and it's not all that bad. He makes me feel secure. Like if I go off on a binge, he can sort of calm me down, but I don't really like it when I go off. I kind of dislike it because I should have control of myself</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds to me like you're saying you really feel out of control. The emotions have the upper hand. You can't find you, just you now this instance you ten seconds from now. There's no Robert to hold your hands. It's scary. [22:10]</p>

<p>PATIENT: See what happened was not like each time we just, like, progressed as far as where I am, who I am and everything. And it's not necessarily all that much fun arguing, but when it comes back it's because I knew him before. I just kind of, I knew before. I just kind of lose where I am and just fall back into it sort of. Although there is something of where I am a present time that's cool when you have direction too. [23:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it sounds like you're saying there are too many realities. The past is in some way just as real as the present. The sadness is that you like your happiness. Your liking him is your feel of disliking him. And somewhere in the middle. . .(inaudible at 23:19). </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, the feelings have been sad the past couple of days. They make a lot of sense to me, and you know I admired him before, but I don't really completely trust him. But I feel I don't really think that I should keep hoping that (inaudible at 23:53). Although proof could be better, you know what I mean, because he has proof.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 23:58) happy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I am. Sometimes during the day I am. But like the happiness thing, I'm thinking if I will work at it . . . trying to control myself for example or work at trying to make things better than I have gotten a little better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think that makes sense.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But this is the thing I'm wondering, do people have to work at things that much or does it come naturally or like?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think there's something good about thinking about how a situation could change, but at the same time you want to think about how it is. Even if it didn't change, how is it? It would be all right to always think about how things could be if you would also think about how things are now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, conflict I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you don't ever think about it that hard, and if you try to think about that, you slip into thinking about how you're going to make it. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think about, well, I think about things. I know I can't help think about things that have happened in the past. [25:06]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For right now it's very real. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You know just, just a, like a tiny little bridge between the past and the future. But not really that I am really now (inaudible at 25:19). Do you think that people have to work hard at making relationships work? Or do they just have to work at it sometimes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think people have to know how they feel now before they can move it along.</p>

<p>You know, if it's pretty good with him, but there are little problems, and you think it's could be good, then you have a good chance of working it out. If it's pretty bad, and there are big problems, then you say maybe it could be (inaudible 25:57). But you have to look at how it is as well. You can't just say well, I'm going to make this work.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PATIENT: When you look at it what (inaudible at 26:09) you look at it (inaudible at 26:14)? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you would look at how you feel now about him.</p>

<p>PATENT: Overall you mean? I think when things go well; I think I want to work at it, but when things aren't pleasant I just want to (inaudible at 26:34) all day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about him now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, today? I just don't in a lot of ways I'm proud of him I think he's been working hard. He's just, he's grown up a little as a person, I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you like him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I like him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he make you happy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do like him just the way he is, but he doesn't make me all that happy. [27:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he make you unhappy?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes he does, yeah. But I'm wondering what makes me unhappy? Is it him really doing it or is it my sensitive sensitivity? You know what I mean? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they are the way they are. They might change you too. It might change him, and it will be two different people. But if that's what you have to have to make somebody work, that's what you have to have. It's easier if you can (inaudible at 27:45). </p>

<p>PATIENT: True. The other thing that bothers me a lot about it is, like, I've dissolved some relationships because I've got certain things that started being taken advantage of. The person is like that, and afterwards, I realize that, like, I was wrong, and I was rather doing it. You know what I mean? [28:12]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You felt bad about it after it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, then it broke up. Yeah, and I talked to my mother about how to handle it, and she said, she said a lot of things don't come easy you have to give and take. You just have to run around that whole part to go . . . </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what I mean to say is that I think it wouldn't be so much a doormat (inaudible at 28:45). If it means that everybody has to become a different person, so what? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can kind of accept people for what they are as long as it's not (inaudible at 29:13). I think I care much more about the person than someone I think about a lot. It's just something that bothers me more. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you say that when you broke off a relationship, and afterwards you were so sad. I'm going to ask you to make a distinction, just for my own (inaudible at 29:48). Is it like afterwards you thought, oh I really made a mistake, I really do like him? Or is it like afterwards you thought, oh God, I shouldn't have done that this time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, because I really liked him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why did you break it off then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I, I thought that . . . that I kind of just basic took advantage of this person. I thought . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought that . . . that I wasn't being respected for my feelings, and I didn't think I was being respected as a person. [30:26]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you weren't being given a chance to be yourself sometimes? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh, not so much that, but I wasn't . . . I wasn't given a chance to be an equal person and therefore you know different sort of like courtesies kind of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like your feelings and wishes weren't taken seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then afterwards, you decided that he really was a nice person who didn't take your feelings and wishes seriously enough and you should have stood up and should have said something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, well I was kind of thinking afterwards that if I had concentrated so much on myself and had become maybe a more, well, if I had become busier and started doing things I would have . . . I don't know if I would, if a person would have seen you as an equal, but I just think I wouldn't dwell so much on the whole matter. Like I sometimes wonder, did I expect too much? I mean, maybe it's just me? I mean, I don't know, like, little courtesies and stuff. Maybe I was just getting too fussy? And this is the thing I've always done with myself, and I just don't know how far to go or how far or how much or you know. [32:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you just never know who to be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can always be just you, you know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know but I don't even know . . . which is really . . . I can't distinguish from who I really am. I can fit myself into different types of roles. Yeah, it's frustrating, like which one is really me or how? [32:32]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But sometimes those people wanted to really offend you and they made you feel like you weren't being treated courteously. You had a sort of distinctive reaction that you didn't want to be there, and you didn't want to be treated like that. Then afterwards you started asking all of these - well, you should have had it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the thing is, like I don't have that instinctive feeling all that much, you know what I mean, that helps you know who you really are. I don't know if it's being flexible or not, but I just can I guess adapt to all these different things. [33:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you can't stop adapting.</p>

<p>PATENT: Yeah, and not, and just have a few that really fit me and bother me a lot </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, in a way I hear you saying this, but seems to you that you don't even know which person you are . . . so flexible in the way you've been. What makes me hear that is that, of course, you are a person. You are not really ten different people. You're only one person. I think see, that sitting here. So there's something about you that's just you all the time. You may not be the same all the time, your feelings may have changed, but it's all you. So what I keep wondering about is whether there isn't something about being you that is hard for you? That makes you keep sort of adopting everybody else's feelings? It's really about your own feelings. [34:01]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe that . . . I know that people would, that maybe, I would be accepted if people would say something about me or put my ideas (inaudible at 34:26) really think of you know or that like I would lose their friendship because I would lose their friendship because I felt one way and showed it. But on the other hand, it wouldn't be such a big thing for me, for me to, to, to kind of talk about it, you know what I mean? [34:50]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's easy to. That really comes easy. My question is why don't you not compromise sometimes and be you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you afraid people wouldn't (inaudible at 35:05) over if it was just you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I think there might be like a big fight or big scene about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid there'd be a lot of anger if you were just you? A lot of fighting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I believed it my mind, and I pressed the point and became a person . . . then there might be a (inaudible 35:36. The other person wouldn't really even bother and just say 'forget it.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like if you were you then it'd be real unpleasant because then you'd have to be different. You'd be different from other people. Your way, you're always the same as whomever you're with. You just change in each environment, and then you suffer because you can't find yourself. The other way you're afraid you would be human just because you were different from other people. There would be all this unpleasantness inside of you.. [36:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I would (inaudible at 36:10). I don't like to fight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that's a realistic fear that if you were yourself you would inevitability end up fighting with people all of the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think with some of them; not all of them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are a couple of them I know I would. My girlfriend for one.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel like it's important or not to stay with those people so you' just stop being yourself altogether?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I always thought so because I guess I value their opinions. They do mine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They need them more than your own? This way whenever your (inaudible at 37:07) or just becoming a girlfriend, or becoming (inaudible at 37:08) or becoming anybody, then you'll need a therapist I'm afraid, and company (inaudible at 37:15). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sometimes it's not, it's not knowing their opinions. I guess it's maybe an opinion that would please them. But I like to always think that I've been honest in what I've said in being a person. [37:35]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure you have. The only person you're shortchanging is yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Could that be why I end up thinking about things so much? About each thing so much? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's part of never knowing what you really thought about, </p>

<p>never letting yourself see how you felt about all of these things. And trying to change the reality before you found out what it is. And then, you do something and start feeling sad and then tell yourself it's really good. You spend weeks telling yourself it's really good, and it's finally gets good, and then you start telling yourself it's really bad again. It's pretty hard for yourself to let yourself just feel the way you feel about things. [38:20]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um- huh, the best thing to do is just kind of look at the situation or whatever before you even go into it, right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay you do that now. You do that now. The trouble is once you look and see what you think; you start talking to yourself anyway. One way or another, it's very hard for you to let yourself just be you and do what you think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I don't know . . .I . . . you know what you just said? I don't know. I just started doing that the past couple of years, and I've always done that you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Done for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: To know what I am? Not really but I just kind of (inaudible at 39:14) events or anything. Like what you said, it's kind of true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's what you've been saying. Just change all the time. And I take it that's what's making you really unhappy these days just not being able to know who you are, not being able to relax. [39:36]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, not to know how I feel about particular things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I think it's going to be hard to know how you feel in the beginning because you haven't done that much, found out, you always ask yourself how you're going to transform it but your going to have to dive into it to ever know how it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would that really be realistic? Is this something all human beings do kind of? I know people do dream do most people like think about things or relationships when they first enter them? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, but they also think about how it is. They're really not thinking about how it could be. The only place where you hurt yourself is by not letting yourself know how it is now. Like when you were telling me about that story about the locket. You told me that whole story, and there was nothing in that story but pain. How you suffered doing it, you suffered afterwards, you really haven't been able to put it aside. And if you do you off you're going to feel bad about it. That's really obvious that's something you shouldn't do because it hurts you. Or maybe you will do it even though you know it hurts you, but you want to know that it hurts you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know it. I believe that like thinking about something meant that it was good news. Isn't that what it means?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the stuff you said about the locket sounded like it hurt you. Now sometimes you may think about something like you might be thinking about a picnic and how nice it was. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I only, well it really like I said, bothered me after I had it that I stole it, but while I was doing it, I don't think it was pain I went through.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How much pain does there have to be before you allow that it hurt you? I mean really terrific, over rolling and get down on the ground? Kind of what I'm thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Something really makes me see that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR" Well, you did see it though.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but afterwards.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, afterwards. [42:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: So how can I start to start to judge others even?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well one thing you know for sure is that it didn't make you happy doing it. That gives you some information about whether you want to do it again. And then, all right so maybe you'll do everything for a while the first time why? At least (inaudible at 42:24) sit down and talk about it and not just talk yourself out of it. Call all your friends on the telephone and get them to tell you how things you think are bad are really good and things you think are good are really bad so you don't know what you're thinking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what your gonna start me to do now? Steps like going to this situation like say stealing something again you're going to have me comparing situations. It's going to be something else to deal with I guess. [43:12] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's just sort of like comparing your feelings. The main thing is really just so you know how you felt, and then you take care of yourself so that if things hurt you, don't do them. And if things make you happy, you do them. And make it sound simple, you know, because sometimes it's real hard to know how you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I say, it's not like I can get up and go out of here and not ever (inaudible at 43:42).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I think you, I think you can begin to try to find out how you feel when things happen about them the way they are, and then if you could see yourself trying to think about how they could be. Also think about . . . think about how they could be, but also think about think about they really are how you really feel right now what you really want right now and once you know that, then think about how they could be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what's happened to me a lot of times like when something is like the situation is good a lot of times it's just over right away, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, when I discovered my favorite bat or something it kind of, it's lingering on and like sometimes there is good in it and sometimes there's bad. There is bad in it and on the one hand, I'm just reassuring myself or dragging me down because I know there will be consequences that will be good. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I think that's right. Sort of like my situation is good you just enjoy it while it happens. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't really want it to go on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, even when it's bad you just sort of can't just say it's bad. You just keep going over it and try to make it into something good. [45:03]</p>

<p>PATIENT: How come, how come the good situations are always so short?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the question is how come the bad ones are so long? In other words, situations are short so if it's good, it should be short; while it lasts it's good. If it's bad, it should be bad, while it lasts it's bad. It's short. The thing that's different, and actually it's bad, you go through it for weeks and weeks over and over telling yourself there's really good in it, and it really wasn't bad. And you saw you were unhappy, but you really weren't. And if you were unhappy, you weren't that unhappy. And if it was bad, it wasn't that bad and besides you had a good pocket (inaudible at 45:42) Sort of like it's really hard for you to walk into a room and say, "I don't like it here." You know. You know, anywhere you have to stay in the room and keep working it around to your liking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's true a lot of times</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just go up and go over and try to make it better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: . . . something to do then, something that will. (inaudible at 46:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think it's why you don't know how you feel because when you feel bad, you don't let yourself feel bad. You start working on it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know. Do you think you know why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I said I think what's important is that's why you don't know how you feel because you don't let yourself know when you feel bad. Start working on it. Start changing it, making it feeling good. In the end you really don't know how you feel. The bad things been turned all around now it's good. And there are these good things, which are good but they're different from . . . </p>

<p>PATIENT: The only way, the only way I'm gonna start doing like you said, seeing how things really are separating it from what I'd like it to be is to have like a notebook, pad or paper with it written on to remind myself every couple of minutes. It's sure hard to do a (inaudible at 47:11).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh man, how do I feel now? (laughter)</p>

<p>That's what I've been doing with that poem you know I found, 'do instead of think.'</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you should think about how you feel. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, but I'd have to do it to get myself thinking on it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I guess anyway it sounds like you're changing all of the time. It's causing you a lot of trouble but no way the reason why you're scared to just be you just because you're afraid there would be a lot of anger and unpleasantness if you really showed. Do you want to talk about that some?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What? I don't know. I guess maybe it's because, when I have to leave and just things have gone all along I guess, the only thing I can associate it with is maybe like at home, like grades at school or something. I guess I didn't so much get real good grades, and there were some subjects that I hated that I really did bad in. And my family, for example my father, never really expressed individuality. He just wanted to follow a certain pattern, a type of person. And my mother, she didn't have any of her own opinions about it. She kind of, she kind of said, "Be yourself." But there my father was always kind of directing her mind. My father, he never told me (inaudible at 49:11). . . . Yeah, he yelled at me particularly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whenever you didn't just do this. . . </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, maybe my younger sister, he didn't want to. The only thing I do remember right . . . maybe what you see or read in magazines or newspapers about the perfect person or look or mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you really sort of decided that you were going to just do it to get longer? [50:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I tried to, and I didn't succeed very well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty hard to be (inaudible at 50:04).</p>

<p>PATIENT: See the thing is, what I did, I enjoyed it a lot of times. And when I think about doing what my father or someone else wanted, I think if I could have done it. I would have enjoyed it. You know what I mean? Because when I thought about it, but in doing the things I did do, I found out some of the (inaudible at 50:36) so bad, and I learned a lot that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really expected that everything that you wanted to do was going to turn out bad if your father didn't want you to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh-huh. I didn't expect it to turn out bad. Well, yeah maybe I did. Not bad so much as is this going to be the right thing? [51:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: More important to be right than just valid and not do anything wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or maybe trying to do everything right, I couldn't do it right. It did turn out different for me, but then I found out that sometimes it wasn't such a tragedy after all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You thought if you didn't conform all down the line the world would come crashing to a close. You stepped out of bounds. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Whenever I looked at the world that way, my father he'd really get angry, and you'd never hear the end of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually what caused giving up on yourself at all? If you break out of line and do anything different from the way that other people want it, then you're going to get yelled at for the rest of your life. [51:56]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess, I guess like I had one sister older, and she did everything right. Like when I was younger, my father used to say you're going to do the same thing as your older sister, all that paper thing. And I thought, oh yes, that'd be great and everything. And I tried it. I just came out a lot different, but like you said before, up until a couple of years ago or just last year, I think t was, I really rejected doing things with her, competing with her, and then I realized I got over it that it wasn't so bad being different. Well you see my sister was so kind of rigid. It was always kind of fun to shock her with some of the things I did. I'd kind of shake her up a bit too. So it wasn't, like I said, it wasn't all that bad, like, for me and the actual thing and relating it to other people. [53:16]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They were always afraid that you'd actually catch it and end up getting scared. Afraid not so you really always tried to do it her way, it was just that you couldn't quite carry on. I guess you're still trying to do it the way they want so nobody will win. </p>

<p>PATIENT: How is it you're (inaudible at 53:47)? You're probably right, but I think the thing that would make it all right would be if I could really say in my mind that you really be yourself. I guess I would feel, I guess I'd really can think for myself. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think part of you didn't want to. Like you said, you decided not to do it when you were a kid. You were going to be like your sister and do what your father wanted, and like you say, even now sometimes you decide you're just going to figure out what other people want and do it. So you have made the other decisions without realizing you've kept it inside of you not that you feel like those other people and try to please them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And like I said, sometimes I jump over and do something as a joke or surprise </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Afterwards you wonder what you really should have done.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I wonder, I go back and I think (inaudible at 55:06).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think the right and the best thing to do is probably what your father or somebody else wants or what you want?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I, I, I think I've always been made to feel dependent on my father, on my parents and that kind of life that I kind of stick to and that's wrong, no matter what I do. I guess deep down I'm saying you know, please (inaudible at 55:50). Then I guess I feel bad about it or . . .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still feel like you shouldn't do your things any different from anyone else. If it feels like the right and best thing, if you could only do it would be to just do it. It makes it real hard. And that other part of you that can't stand being different to all the family seeing other people, okay why don't you just be one (inaudible at 56:30).</p>

<p>Seems like, it isn't all that simple but no way you're going to have to make that decision for yourself whether you're going to keep trying to make a go of being the perfect rag person and do it everybody else's way. And then you know you're going to have to live with the fact that you're gong to feel like a different person all of the time, and you're going to be losing yourself and changing your moods all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How would you go about, say, ridding your mind of wanting to take chances to establish yourself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe if you find out what's it means for you. Why it's important?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I know it means security. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 57:36)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and acceptance I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 54:46) So you feel like if you didn't yield on all those things, nobody would take care of you or protect you. (inaudible at 58:00)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Possibly. I never really had to take care of myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You started figuring for yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: If I didn't care of myself then I guess I'd be alone.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You imagine that you'd be terribly alone if you just acted the way you felt. Why? Do you feel that the way you act is so unacceptable so awful?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess to people I care about it is. The people that love me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How, how different do you suppose you could have acted from yourself all this time? (inaudible 58:50)</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you mean, doing everything my parents wanted?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or just, see what I mean is when you just . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. It is the other things I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, (inaudible at 59:01). Like, well here is the real (inaudible, patient's name at 59:06) who is this person and she should do and everybody (inaudible at 59:11) takes care and likes you. And then there's (inaudible at 59:14) and when you do everybody likes and takes care of you. But the way you describe them, it's like, this one all the way over here now and all the way over there. (inaudible at 59:27) By a mile, yeah. Sort of like you have yourself so far out that if you acted like yourself they wouldn't even recognize you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, the way that I think I've been made to feel by my dad, by my parents or something. I don't know. My father like, he'd always say . . .he said something the other day about me. Something that made me ask, "What did I do wrong?" (inaudible at 60:00) my mother and I . . . guess it'd been about having sex, which was really, really, really, really bad. But I don't know it seemed like my father always had the answers he was some sort of encyclopedia or something. It's funny, my sister and her husband . . . she dropped out of college for six months, and all this, and my dad got really angry at her. And he wouldn't talk to her and she developed some kind of traumatic, well something took place that really affected her. And he just made her feel that she was really a devil or something like that. And he did all these things. He wouldn't talk to her and cut off her tuition and all. And he just hurt everybody. He was (inaudible at 61:05) constantly. That was just . . . and it's odd, he just made her feel like some kind of monster </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why you keep your folks so far away?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know he did with school grades. I think that was about the biggest thing. Because he's was real gung ho, degrees and all this, and getting married and raising a family (inaudible 61:39) and he never, he never would accept people that were different from him. And he doesn't have that many friends at all. [61:54] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like he's a pretty hard guy. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of like . . . he tears my two brothers-in-law apart. He calls (inaudible at 62:07). He constantly tears everybody apart, and sometimes I wonder does he need to go that far? But he has (inaudible at 62:20).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like he may be feeling awfully bad about himself. But on the other hand, there's something in you that's still just dying to please him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I always thought he was such an important person because he always was the masculine kind who took care of us and everything, our whole family is just girls. You know, just being the male and the father. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean about the way he asked you do things, and he made you feel like you had to do them and if you didn't do them . . . [63:00] </p>

<p>PATIENT: He demanded of us most of the time, he demanded us. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And even now it's seems like it's really hard for you (inaudible at 63:08) the feeling of you just wish you could have done it his way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, he still tries to control all four of us. Well not all four of us since (inaudible at 73:20) so. He still does. And it's like I told you before, it's a constant fight for me to, to just be my own boss. </p>

<p>Because I have this terrible fear I'll fall back in my parents' clutches. The other day my mother was, we were driving, and she kept saying don't do this and don't do that and everything and I started screaming at her because I just felt that she was just taking over my personality and controlling me. [63:57]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds to me like the hardest part for you is that they're still so effective on you. It's not just that they do it, but it's like they really get to you. So you still . . .when they say you're a bad boy, you really go on and feel bad. [64:11]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and it bothers me that they still are so effective . . .and then when I stand up for myself, I feel bad because in a way they've been hurt. A lot of things they react, and they show it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They tend to get angry?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or they'll pout or something. [64:37]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds like, in a way, you're in some kind of compromised state now in your own mind where you've got some freedom, and in exchange for hanging on to it, you don't dare rock the boat because if you (in audible at 64:52) too wild, you'll end up back home again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because like if I had a financial burden or anything else I feel like the only ones that I could turn to who could help straighten things out would be my parents. Because like for my rent, my first month's rent, I had a little security deposit, and I had to borrow from my dad and everything. Well, and it made me feel again that I was back in his clutches, but there wasn't anyone else at that time, like my sisters, that I could borrow from, so I did it. He let me keep the money, I mean; I didn't have to repay him back or anything. But in a way that makes me feel indebted to him. It resulted in my mind thinking controlled for another month or two. [66:00] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of sounds like you're saying that . . .</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother, for example. She calls me every morning at the same time and asks me the same questions. I'll answer her politely, but I won't go into long statements or anything and she'll say, "Goodbye, I call you tomorrow." And sometimes, I can feel she knows I'm cutting her off. And I, like again I feel back because I'm doing it and everything, but it just really annoys me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like she's checking up on you almost.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, making sure you're still there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in a way, part of you probably feels like she's the only person who would know if you weren't okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I'm tempted to tell her something really bazaar, but I don't. You know, it really annoys me. [67:04]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like wanting to be able to have them to fall back for security and all, but then feeling like every time you do fall back on them like you've just lost some really important battle for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I've lost moving an inch or two forward, being my own boss and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it seems like, in a way, it's expensive security for what you pay for it almost. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah like I'm wondering if I really, if I really yelled and spoke my own mind and perhaps really offending them, would they, if I needed help or something, would they still come? And knowing my father, it'd be a whole new thing with him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like kind of what you've been saying today is that if you were yourself, you would do an awful lot of yelling. You're afraid that if you started acting like yourself, you would really be angry. [68:15]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, and they've told me over and over too that I have a bad temper. And my father always says something. When I yelled at home because I always did feel like that I was (inaudible at 68:30) and they were all standing around me. My father would always say you have to develop a pleasing personality or nobody will want to be friends with you and everything like that.

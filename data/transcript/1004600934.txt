<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Information?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I've been thinking about that, but I feel like maybe some of the reactions have been—things do come from that and, um—like, for example, before all this madness, before it was just—a few months ago, I was just into, like, writing and struggling with that, um, and just look at, like, people my age and maybe still a little older, or even younger, um, who get discovered, like new writers. Um, and—this is when I was working full-time, so I'd work—if there was a folder that I would just look at upcoming, emerging writers and their first books, and that would [chuckles] depress me so much. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and—like, yesterday, one of my friends—she's not exactly a friend; she was a student the year after me—um, and I just kind of look at her and feel very resentful in many ways. [00:01:12]</p>

<p>Like, she comes from a much better family. Like, her dad is a—a very well-known artist, so she's—she's gone to school with, like, the royalty and actors and actresses. And she came the year after me, and so she got a lot of, um, good things because of that. Like, when I was at the university, they had just started this travel program. Um, it was the first year of that grant, so only two people from our class got it. I wanted to go to Iran and research my grandfather's story, and I put together an application, but I didn't get the grant; someone else did. [00:02:01]</p>

<p>At that time, my—like, the director and our professor—he was very, kind of—he wanted everyone to get something, so they gave me the award for, like, the Best Student, but that was just like 500 bucks. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And then travel grant was going to be, like, $7,000, $8,000, and it is—like, the way that they had been promoting it and stuff, it has come out to be a really, really prestigious thing. Like, when people ask me about the Program, the first thing that they say is, "Don't they have this cool new travel thing, travel fellowship?" And [chuckles] I say, "Yeah." And it is funny because, like, they have these picnics, and they invite alumni, so I go to them, and this guy who gave, like, the million dollars for the grant—he—you know, like, my professor has always introduced me to him, and then, "Oh, yeah, she's this good student," and stuff, and, "Watch out for her," and whatnot, and he's all—and so the millionaire guy is like, "Oh, why didn't you get it? You know, your project sounds interesting." And I'm like, "Ummm, it was your decision," [chuckles] but I didn't say it then. [00:03:10]</p>

<p>So this girl– she got—she went to Iran, not because she had any historical connection with the country like I had this sort of connection with Iran, but she got it, and—I mean, she is very sweet but she is very cosmopolitan. She comes from Delhi. She is half Spanish and half Indian, so, you know, she is—she's successful and [inaudible at 00:03:38] (ph) [chuckles]—I don't know about that. But, I mean, like, I just feel kind of resentful that she got the fellowship only because she came the year after, and, the year after, they gave it out to six people. [Chuckles] So it is like practically everyone got it. And they're all moving to places like Italy and Spain—you know, places that people want to go to for vacation. You know? [00:04:02]</p>

<p>And I applied—I sent my story in for a contest, and I got the runners-up. And she applied to the same contest the year after me, and she got the runners-up, as well, [chuckles] but her story was published on the website just because, again, they're doing things differently that year. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] So I just feel really, like, you know, she's luckier in the sense that she can actually claim that story as a publication, whereas I can only say it won an award; I cannot say that that magazine published me. So [pauses]—I don't know. Like, I—I hate comparing myself to other people, just because, I mean, I'm just going to drive myself crazy if I keep comparing—you know, when I start comparing myself to—I don't know—the most successful writer. What is that going to do? [I mean, I should—you know, I] (ph) told me several times, like, "You focus on what you have, and, you know, your success will only be counted as to what you did with your circumstances, not what you did with something you didn't have." [00:05:19]</p>

<p>You know? So I don't know. I need to work on that. [Sighs] But (ph) I don't know how to stop thinking from—you know, or acting from that sense of loss and having been deprived of stuff, so [voice trails off]—I guess. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, this is certainly not a new experience. I think it extends way back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you feel understandably so, that, in many respects, you were given kind of a raw deal. [00:06:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] But people have that. Right? I mean, lots of people get raw deals, and they're fine, I think. [Chuckles] [pauses for five seconds] I just don't—I want to be generous [pauses] and, you know, less bitter (ph) and [pauses]—so [pauses] I think my interaction with Victor (ph) also went really bad because of—because I acted from that sense of deprivation; I really did. I was like, "Oh, well, [just having me around] (ph) and having this kind of romance, and now I rarely get it." [Chuckles] I don't—so that's—that's going to put anyone off. Um, so, since Monday, like, I've just been going back and forth, back and forth, analyzing and overanalyzing, like the whole Victor (ph) situation and written to him countless times. [00:07:02]</p>

<p>Like, I haven't actually sent him anything, just like letters and e-mails, and thoughts that I've had. Um, I don't even know—like, my mom says that I shouldn't, at all—contact him at all because she's afraid he—he'll take that as stalking and [chuckles] take some action, but I wonder if I sh—if I should, you know, like just, for my piece of mind and maybe—yeah, just to resolve things and just to hope for the future or not hope for it, or just to put things in a positive note, if I should just send him something before I leave. I'm not sure if I should do that; sometimes, I think I shouldn't, but, other times, I think I should. Um, [pauses] I don't know. </p>

<p>[Silence for four seconds] [00:08:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel he can offer you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that lost hope of having—when—yeah, like—in one letter, I was telling him that, you know, the night he kicked me out [chuckles]—or the morning that we had—where we had, like, the decision of us living together and, you know, me maybe working and you (ph) taking time off and working on your (ph) films and stuff. Um, so [chuckles] [fidgets]—when—yeah, I just thought that he and I connected in a very different and better way than David (ph) and I connected, and, like, [pauses]—you know, that—that physical chemistry is good, and I had an exper—I mean, I am inexperienced in that regard, as he says, but I just—I guess I wanted that, and [pauses]—yeah, I guess that sense of feeling very safe [pauses] in his company. [00:09:13]</p>

<p>Um, but it is—it is such a—it is such a bad thing. Like, now that I've had some distance from him—I haven't seen him in, like, two weeks—um, I feel—I feel a bit normal again; I feel like myself. Um, I'm reading more and thinking more about my own projects. Um, [pauses] so I don't really know. Like, I guess I am confused about him, but [pauses] I thought that that was, you know, important, you know, like having [pauses]—yeah, I thought what he and I had was important, and it could be the basis of a good relationship, but not if he is, like, [slaps hand in lap] so unsure. [00:10:05]</p>

<p>In one minute, he is pushing you, and the next, he is holding me close and—it is [chuckles] probably—I don't know. In one letter, I want to tell him, "Yes, I did go crazy, but I had a lot of help [chuckles] from—from you." You know? So—and he really did let me—lead me to think that pauses] he liked me a lot. You know? So I'm not saying he should take some of the blame. There is no blame game, it is just that—at the end of the day, [I don't want him too badly of me,] (ph) I guess...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...And to see if we can salvage our friendship because—or not. I—I don't know. Like, at least he wasn't really that good of a friend, anyways. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>Before all this happened, we were just—he had started to come back (ph) because he lives kind of close by, and David (ph) and I would go over and watch movies at his place. And it was just movies. I mean—well, they are the greatest movies ever made, so that chuckles]—that's kind of good, but [pauses]—I don't know—I just—it really, really, really hurts to, like—to think that I won't have him in my life again, especially with me. You know—reach (ph) a million times, "You only love me, you know, like –"—and this was before he was flaming mad at me, [chuckles] but, you know, one holds on—holds onto his words. You know? Like words of affirmation and comfort... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I guess one shouldn't. [Chuckles] [slaps hands in lap] </p>

<p>[Silence for five seconds] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't get a lot of that growing up. [00:12:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, again, acting from a sense of, you know, desperation and deprivation—that's wrong. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it is interesting because I—I had talked to you about the affirmation last session, but that was the other thought. The word that came to my mind is sort of feeling desperate. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you have to get it, you have to get it now, you have to get it from him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely. [Pauses] I was on a date last night with this guy. There's another thing that I haven't told you yet, and I feel really horrible [chuckles] about it [slaps hand in lap]—about this thing, about not telling you. But [chuckles] there was this dating site. For a few months now, I've had—like, I'm going out on dates and stuff. Um, [sniffles] but this guy was telling me about having this kind of an experience where a girl was stalking him. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>Um, and I was just actually fascinated by [chuckles] that story because I've been on [chuckles] the other side. I've been that girl. But, then again, this girl was calling him 300 times, he said, and she called him at 2 a.m., in the morning. Like, she—he would come home, and he would—she would be right there at—you know, waiting for him. I've done the latter; I have, you know, waited for Victor (ph) in his parking lot, and I've actually texted him and said, "I'm waiting," [chuckles] and then, later, he said, "Not coming home." But then this guy said, "What if someone did that to you." You know? "This is like holding a gun to my head, and I'm not going to –." And then I completely realized that, "Wow, yes, what if someone had done that to me?" What if they were waiting at my doorstep? That would freak me out. You know? And they were just all, like, "I love you. Please —." And I've had that done to me in the sense that, you know, people—guys have professed their love, and I've been, like, "No." That's made me even less interested in them, and even less, so I guess, now, I see his point of view. [00:14:06]</p>

<p>I'm always sad [in seeing] (ph), this point of view. [Chuckles] I mean, but I—I feel like—yeah, I mean I—I see that I was wrong in doing that. That was acting out of desperation. Um, [pauses] but I feel like—[sighs] so, I mean, the reason I—one of the reasons—I'm not saying—I'm not denying that I wasn't desperate and that I went berserk and stuff, but—but, like—like, every time I did that earlier, like [pauses]—um, I went over—the first time—the second time I barged into his place, he said—he was very loving. He said, "So will I see you tomorrow?" And I said, "Why? We could just see each other tonight?" And—'cause, in my head, it was like, "Wow, I can't believe my luck. He wants to actually see me in just a few hours." So he was like, "Well, no one has ever fallen for me like this. No one has ever cared for me enough to come barging in for me." [Slaps hands in lap] [00:15:14]</p>

<p>So there! And I was like, "OK, this is good behavior. This is positive reinforcement for what I did." [Chuckles] You know? And the next time, um, I didn't barge in, but he came for his keys, and I was all a [non-screamer] (ph). I was like, "No, no," and stuff. So the next morning, he was like, I have tell David (ph) because I cannot [slaps hand in lap] beat about the bush because this—I cannot walk away from a love such as this. Again, you know, even more positive reinforcement [chuckles] for going crazy. So I continued to go crazy because I thought he likes damsels in distress, or, you know, he likes to be in that powerful role of being the rescuer and whatnot. [00:16:03]</p>

<p>So [pauses] I thought my crazy behavior tells him that I love him. So I continued to do that chuckles] until last Monday; that was my last crazy behavior, but he didn't like it then. So [chuckles]—so I'm not really sure. Like, he goes from feeling like I'm putting a gun to his head, to being, like, "Oh, no, I like strong women who are cold and can have casual sex with me and that's it." [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm not saying that, you know, he cannot be wishy-washy, that he cannot be like [pauses]—and he cannot change his mind whenever he likes, but, since I am not strong, I am going to react weirdly to his mood swings. You know? [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Since you're "not strong?" </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] Well, he says, you know, that his—he thinks my maturity level is not the same as him at all. He has lost all hopes of ever interacting with me like an adult. He has lost all respect for me, and I'm juvenile. [Chuckles] [00:17:14]</p>

<p>I mean, I'm saying—I said—I put it in air quotes just because I sometimes think I have certain strengths. I thought, like, holding onto something that I thought was love is strong. I mean, it is putting your heart before your head, and, right now, I feel like I cannot do that anymore and not [want to desire] (ph). I mean, [pauses] I don't know. I feel like I have strengths. Like, [pauses] two days ago, our landlord calls and says, "Oh, you cannot live here anymore. My daughter is going to move in." [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, now, on top of finalizing my apartment, I have to find my mom an apartment, as well. And I didn't freak out. I—I was a little hurt because he'd already—he is this weird guy who is, like—he needs four months' notice every year for us—from us that we are going to continue our lease, but he gives us a lot less notice. [00:18:18] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, I mean, I didn't—I didn't get upset. I was like, "Fine," and I was on Craigslist the next second, and lined up places. So, I mean, I don't know. Maybe that isn't really a sign of strength, but I'm just saying, like, it is—I'm trying to, as they say, roll with the punches. You know? So—but when it comes to love, yeah, I am a little bit weird or whatever, just 'cause I let me heart rule my head in that case; um, but maybe not anymore. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would happen if you didn't find an apartment for your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I hope I do. I mean, it is just the pressure of looking and signing the lease. [Chuckles] [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I'm just asking what would—would she live under a bridge? Like, what would she do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: [Chuckles] A bridge? [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I mean, like if you didn't do it, what would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't imagine—I couldn't imagine the scenario. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would she—I mean, would she be homeless? Like, what would happen? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, so I'm not—I'm wondering what—yeah, what would happen. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I—I—like I said, I cannot imagine not doing this. [Chuckles] I feel like, you know, I'm looking for—even more than my place, I'm putting a lot of effort into finding a place for her. For me, I don't care where I live. [Slaps hand in lap] I looked at maybe—I looked at four places for myself, but, for her, I'm really—I want her to find a really nice place. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why can't she do it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm sure she can do it; it is just she hasn't [pauses] done it before, so—I mean, I'm right here, so I—[slaps hands in lap] I kind of find it fun to look at places. [Chuckles] So it is just something—something nice that I want to do. I mean, it is not even nice; it is just something I have to do. [00:20:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or there is a big difference between "it is fun" and "I have to do it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is both. I am trying to combine it, 'cause I know I have fun looking at places. 
THERAPIST: But you can look at places for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but, for me, I don't really care that much. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I—I feel bad for moving out. I made her cry when I first brought it up, so I feel bad about—plus, I'm—I was just wondering, you know, like, "Are we so sad? Will I be sad?"
And I'm crying. I'm like, [said in a childlike manner] "I need my mommy." [Chuckles] But I don't know. [Pauses] Yeah, I mean, I feel guilty for moving out, so I don't [pauses]—I'm not really that much emotionally invested in a place of my own or, you know, my living situation. [00:21:09]</p>

<p>I'm just hoping I'll just be buffeted (ph) along with—[sighs] with the enthusiasm that maybe comes from that, from a new place and new roommates and stuff. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like she's a child?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yes, [eventually] (ph), like she's my child. [Chuckles] But I guess we play different roles at different times. [Slaps hand in lap] [Pauses] I don't know if I feel like I can run into her arms or anything. [00:21:51]</p>

<p>Um, [pauses for 20 seconds] do you feel I should write to him or no?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Softly] Hmm (ph)—I wonder what—we were just talking about your mother, and I wonder why your mind went right back to him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is—my mind is really weak (ph). [Chuckles] It is a one-track mind these days. [Chuckles] [Pauses for ten seconds] I guess I'm just not that emotionally invested in my mom right now, so—I mean it is—it is at the root—it is the root cause of stuff, maybe, and it is at the back of my mind. It is in the back of and, in the foreground, there's other stuff, I guess. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:23:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, [pauses for 11 seconds] Sure. [Chuckles] [shifts in seat] [pauses for 20 seconds] I'm not sure if not living with her is going to suddenly make me feel less responsible for her happiness and stuff. You know? [Shifts in seat].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That is just where I'm worried when I do worry [chuckles] about her [chuckles] even if, after we're living separately. She was, like, telling me when I first mentioned it, "You're just going to keep worrying about me and thinking about me, so you shouldn't move out." [Chuckles] Um, [pauses] and that worried me. I was like, "Well, she's probably right." [Chuckles] [00:24:14]</p>

<p>[Pauses for four seconds] But, in college, I don't think I worried about her too much. I mean, I was living in the dorms, and she was—she had her own apartment in a different part of the town, so [pauses for 37 seconds]... [00:25:00]</p>

<p>I just feel like a lot there, um—like, she and I have had, like, [slaps hand in lap]—like, a lot more stuff [slaps hand in lap] than, I think, just a normal or usual mother-daughter kind of a thing. I mean, we'll—um, [sighs] [pauses for four seconds]—like, and every single thing that she's done for me in my childhood, I feel, is like alone. You know? [Chuckles] [pauses for four seconds] She used to tell me that, um, she tried really hard to get me into the general (ph), like, [English-meeting] (ph) schools because they were better than the non-English-meeting schools. [00:26:05]</p>

<p>And, um, one time, she—I gave the—and, in there, you have to give entrance exams for good schools; you cannot just fill out an application and have them give you a spot. If you don't have much money, you give them—we have to take an entrance exam to show that you're smart enough, and I did this for several schools, and one of them, I didn't quite pass but I was close, um, so we went back to my old school where my mom was teaching—it is another school—and as part of the challenge (ph), she suddenly just had this urge, she says, that she just had to leave, and she told her principal she was going; she had this massive headache. It was a really hot day. She was walking in the sun. She took a rickshaw. She said that she nearly had a heatstroke [chuckles] or something. [00:27:01]</p>

<p>She went all the way to the—to meet the principal or admissions counselor of the school which had given the entrance exam, and asked to look at my answer sheet. [Chuckles] And she found out that—that the teacher hadn't added up my numbers correctly, my score correctly, so I had actually passed the entrance exam. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I've done very well. And then she was elated, and she got me admitted into this nice—nicer school. But I just—I can just see her, kind of picture her, you know, [pauses] sitting under a challenge (ph), like it being a hot day in the city and, like, just having this hunch that—you know, that I'd done well and I'd passed, and—and I'm not stupid, and [chuckles] [00:27:59]</p>

<p>That's [my mother] (ph). Like, I feel like I really owe her for [slaps hands in lap] that and, you know, things like that, so [slaps hands in lap]—it is not something you can pay back because it is like, you know, these things—they change who you are; you know, they change the course of your life, so no amount of money is going to do that. I guess, in Victor's (ph) words, I cannot walk away from love like that. You know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Sniffles] [becomes emotional, possibly begins to cry] And, sometimes, I really do feel like, if I have a soulmate, it is probably my mom because [chuckles] she's the person that I've spent most of my life with and [sniffles] [slaps hands in lap] [pauses for 11 seconds]... [00:29:00]</p>

<p>I mean, I feel grave for her that she didn't have [sighs] a very successful marriage. Um, [sniffles] but I know that my dad's actions have nothing to do with me. You know? But I do feel like—and she keeps saying that, saying this, and she will keep on saying it forever and ever, and that, "You needed a father in your life, so I had to take him back." [Chuckles] So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then separated after—even before I was born to, like, for the first six years of my life, my dad wasn't around. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I distinctly remember the day that I first saw him. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We picked him up from the train station, and I called him "Uncle," and he stayed at the hotel for a few days, for like a week, and then he moved into our apartment. So [chuckles] ... [00:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did your mother ever talk about him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't remember. Um, [pauses] I don't know. [Chuckles] [pauses] Just the other day, she was like, "Yeah, you and I would have been so much happier if it was just us," and I was like, "Exactly." [Chuckles] You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but, yeah, yeah. She and I had a good time. She—she and I have had really good times. We've discovered different religions together. Like, when—as I child, I would accompany her to this [pauses]—I don't know—it is not exactly like going to the temple. It is—we used to go to this—these people's homes, and they would have, like readings of letters from this guru. There are all kinds of stuff like that in India. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [00:30:53]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then, in college, um, I had [pauses]—I was "saved." [Chuckles] I became a Christian for five years. And I'm not sure if I'm still a Christian; I haven't checked in with Jesus in a [chuckles] long time. But—then the first person whose soul I wanted to save after I became Christian was my mom, so—and then, you know, she got "saved." And she still kind of [slaps hand in lap] goes to church intermittently. Um, [pauses] [slaps hand in lap] so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you want to save her from?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, whatever they say—you know, eternal damnation and whatnot. [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and I was saying, like, we've experienced stuff like this together, and, you know, I've not experienced this with any boyfriend or whatever; and I won't because [slaps hands in lap] [chuckles] I realize it is just not going to be—I'm just not going to have the same dynamic with anyone else. You know, with me and her, it is like a sense of responsibility, a sense of guilt and shame, and, like, all that pauses]—and love. [Chuckles] [00:32:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it is not a typical mother-daughter relationship at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like it is not clear if she is your soulmate or if she's your sister, or if she's your daughter, or if she is your mother?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] She's everything rolled into one. [Chuckles] But [pauses for three seconds] I (ph) should do couples therapy [slaps hands in lap] for me and my mom [chuckles] . We definitely...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Could qualify as a couple. [Chuckles] A couple of I don't know what. [Pauses for five seconds] I mean, I should feel kind of, in a way, proud of, also, that I have this interesting, weird thing 'cause writers are supposed to experience weird things. [Chuckles] [00:33:04]</p>

<p>Um, [pauses for four seconds] but I don't know; there is too much weirdness and, you know, you can't really have a normal life, which is a prerequisite for producing anything, for doing anything—you know?—a job or producing art [chuckles]—or maybe not producing art, but—I don't know. [Pauses for four seconds] Yeah, it is funny. Like, Victor (ph) is just a small, miniscule part of all of this, but it is strange because I keep saying it, that it is not really him; it is what he represents that has got me so... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...Tied up and confused. So... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:34:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The other day, I had spent all day [chuckles] composing this letter to him—you know, different drafts—[chuckles] and I finally went for a walk, and I imagined him getting this very loving letter from me, in which I'm like, "I really want you to quit your job so that you could work on your films." [Chuckles] In one of my fantasies, he was [he went in a drab, sad station] (ph) and just, you know, take me in his arms. [Chuckles] But then, I'm walking and, suddenly, like, I felt like he would call me and be like, "Why did you send that letter?!" He was [really, really mad at this] (ph), just like my dad (ph)—you know?—um, and that really freaked me out. And I was walking in a daze for several minutes after that, because my last convers—not really conversation—the last I heard from my dad was this voice-mail that he left me—this was in 2003—a very, very nasty voice-mail which I, unfortunately, have taped. I haven't heard it since then, but I just wanted to—as I listen [in the class] (ph) [chuckles]—and then the worst curses, and they're, you know, [whispers] like really horribly mad. [00:35:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was he mad about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I didn't sign my—I didn't want to sign the loan papers for getting a house. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [pauses for four seconds] yeah, that was weird, like, imaging Victor (ph) yelling like my dad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So—and I feel like that's kind of there, also, that maybe he's like [pauses] my dad, in my head, that I have to make—make peace with Victor (ph) because it is like making peace with my dad or "a" dad, or a good dad. You know? [00:36:06]</p>

<p>[Pauses] And if I don't, then, you know, [pauses] I lose out or miss out on that affection. [Pauses for seven seconds] I just don't want to be, you know, desperate anymore, and be—I mean, that's what he would say. He was like, "Are we going to die in December? Is that what it is?" You know, like, "Why can't we wait?" You know, it is—and I'm, "No, no, it can't wait." [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Be like, "No, right now. People tell me I'm pretty, so I'm pretty right now. I don't know. In a couple of years, maybe I'll look really ugly or something like that, or..." [Chuckles] [00:37:00]</p>

<p>[Silence for 12 seconds]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're looking for something in Victor (ph) that you didn't get and that you need. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Reluctantly] Yeah, but now I feel I can do without it. You know, [pauses] if I forget about all these associations in my head and then just think casually about it, then I—then I would realize that I made the right decision seven years ago, when I picked David (ph). Um, he's not going to be chasing other women. He is going to be faithful and loyal, and he is going to be ambitious and politically active. [00:38:00]</p>

<p>Being with him, I might just make something of my life. I might not have the best romance or [slaps hand in lap] any romance, but I'll be someone, you know, and have a [local stand on] (ph) in the Indian community, which I don't right now, I feel, because I come from nothing. [Chuckles] You know, I don't have a father. Um, [pauses] so if I go with anyone else, even an—any American guy, where—what would be my [local stand] (ph)? I have nothing; I'll have to make it on my own, and I'm not very confident I'll make a good one on my own. And, yeah, if another Indian guy—but, even then, you know, it is—if—yeah, really, Victor (ph) is just not right because I'll never be safe and secure, and sure of the affection because he is—it will always be... [00:39:02]</p>

<p>I mean, he is, like—he is not a Graham (ph), but he is—if he says he is polygamous, then maybe he is like that because they can observe this with Graham (ph). Like, I [pauses]—I'll be with a friend, and he will be there, and he will be talking to my friend the whole time, you know, like really looking at her, like being into her. [Chuckles] But—which, at first, it would make me sad when I had hopes of [pauses]—you know, when I was just attracted to him and wanted him to like me. But, now, that we've been intimate, and I know it is—you know, it is whatever, and I have issues with him, and I could never be in a relationship with him, now, if we're in—I'm like, "Yeah, look at however [chuckles] many women you want to look at." You know? [Chuckles] But I feel like [there I maybe know] (ph) maybe in my head was in the right place, and I [slaps hands in lap]—comparatively—and maybe I made the right decision that I cannot be with a guy like my dad. [Chuckles] You know? [00:40:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It is—it is best—better to have security of emotion. You know? Like, I don't need money; I just need the security of his affection and just, you know, great companionship. So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you were in couple's therapy with your mother, what would you guys work on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have no idea. [Chuckles] I don't know where we'd begin because we're just absolutely—yeah, we'd have way too many [chuckles] issues. We'd be in therapy for years. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: [Speaks softly] It is [pauses] whatever. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>[Pauses for eight seconds] "Why didn't you say this? Why do you feel that way? Why is your version of life always, like, a gun on my shoulder, a gun on my head?" You know? [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what you'd say to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] You know, "Why can't you be happier? Why can't you take a little bit more responsibility? Why couldn't you find a man?" [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "Why did you kill my siblings?" [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which she had—she had abortions and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: After you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, again, I understand her story, but, you know, "Your dad was a basket case," and, "How could I bring more people into the world?" [Chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many abortions did she have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think like three or four or something, so... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Again, she told me this—you know, I was in my twenties, maybe 20, 21. I was like, "What?!" [Chuckles] [00:42:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: "Yeah, I understand you had a really hard life, but you could have said something, like, you were protecting me from all that and..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. You'd have liked siblings?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I would have been a brat with them, but I feel like, right now, it would have been so good to have—I used to have, like, an imaginary [chuckles] brother named John, a name for him and everything, like stories I would tell other people, that, "Yeah, we did that, we did that," and... [chuckles] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So [pauses]...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (ph) we're going to need to stop for today. Did you get my e-mail?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I was just checking in with my boss about Wednesday, so I can do Wednesday at 10, I think. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know what? I realize, also, that I think I gave that time away. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm really sorry. I—I... </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. [00:42:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had forgotten that that was one of the options I gave you. But I think I have a time right around—I really apologize. I had offered it after forgetting that... </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or maybe—yeah—no, I did have—but you know what? I could do—I could do, um, [clucks] nine. Could you do nine on Wednesday?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, like nine...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nine a.m. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let's do that. So I could do nine. So we're meeting 10:45 on Tuesday, and ten on—oh, I'm sorry—nine on Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I'm sorry. What? Ten...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ten forty-five on Tuesday, right? We had that as a regular time, right? </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We are meeting Monday and Tuesday. Is that correct?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's what I—I had you at Monday and Tuesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, yeah, I think so. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: 'Cause I had you 10:10 on Monday and 10:45 on Tuesday. And you had said that you couldn't come at the 10:10 time, but I still have you in for the Tuesday time. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So 10:45 on Tuesday, right? [00:44:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And nine on—on Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and just—I think I had sent you an e-mail with the—with the different times, so if you wanted to look that over again and make sure that was right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten—and nine on Wednesday. OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, 10:45 Tuesday, nine on Wednesday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, great. I will see you on Tuesday, then. </p>

<p>CLIENT: OK. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, take care. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a good weekend. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, thank you. You, too. </p>

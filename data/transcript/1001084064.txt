<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So what happened?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I'm just going crazy.  I'm going from, I can go here, then all the sudden I just totally break into pieces, I just meltdown and - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And you feel depressed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm depressed but then, but then I go to bed at night and I fall asleep and then I wake up with these horrific dreams with an anxiety attack that is just unbelievable and I may have two or three a night.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did this happen since the Lamictal?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I was on what 100?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and you weren't having this.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I was having dreams.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Were you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, yeah, I was having that and I was having the same kind of panic attacks but I went up to 150, well I've been playing with it because I'm just going -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm all over everywhere and I go to bed and well last night, I wouldn't even go to bed because I just knew it was not going to be a good night and I put the water beside the bed with the Xanax because I was afraid, you know, if I had a panic attack, I don't know what to do because these are severe, some of the most severe ones I've had.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I guess we'd better stop it then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not working, I can tell you that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, it's doing something weird to you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I am, it's -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You're not taking that Chantix or anything for, that people use to stop smoking?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, I don't take it.  I'm just taking my regular medicine but it's, all I have to do is just think for a minute and then I start crying and then I'll start sobbing and then I'll be okay.  I mean this all happens and then all the sudden I'll get this in one day, I'll get this sudden burst of energy and I'll just, I was climbing around yesterday, cleaning back behind the grill and I mean I can't even get my head back in there but I had this, it's just, it's like being bipolar but it's hourly.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's the weirdest thing I've ever felt.  I mean I've had chronic depression, you know, but this is just bizarre.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we'd better stop it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's funny it didn't happen in the beginning but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I mean I even had to lower my dose, so then I take 75 one day and then I'd try 100 the next day and then I'd go back on 100, today I'm on 150.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But there was no pattern to it?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I mean it was always the same, it's just been, the dreams are so paranoid, I mean I feel like a paranoid schiz, I really do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you're not - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> These dreams are just, these dreams are just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> People are coming after you?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, all the time, all the time and that's why I wake up in a panic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's not the opposite.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And they're pretty clear, I mean I can remember them but -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, let's figure this out.  We stopped the Lamictal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I can't do that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's got to be connected somehow.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I haven't been, I've never been like this.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No but what do we do next because we're still on, well, we're in a place where antidepressants aren't working.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But the other latest thing, believe it or not, is to try this super folate vitamin because there's more in this than you can take, you know, vitamin pills but if the person, it turns out there's a genetic strain of people that need it and then it makes the medicines work.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  But I've been on a folate, I'm on a folate and a regular vitamin and I'm on 400 on a daily basis plus the vitamin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's still not what this can do and the reason I know that is I just read an article yesterday about it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I read it too and I read about all that folate can do all these other nasty things to you and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well the only other thing is, I'm afraid to use Depakote because that's kind of like Lamictal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I had Depakote and I was just, I was sick, I mean vomitus.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> From that, okay, so the only other thing we've got is some of these newer major tranquilizers.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh shoot.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, but I'd say six or seven years ago, the only thing I would have had to say is shock treatment so at least we have another alternative.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because you've got the Wellbutrin and the Lexapro still.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, I haven't taken the Lexapro.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we should put that back.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You took me off the Lexapro because you said I didn't, I should go with, you told me I could go with the Wellbutrin and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Lamictal.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And Lamictal and then you said you'll probably be able to go off the Wellbutrin, well, I ain't going off the Wellbutrin.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No, no, well then let's put back the Lexapro and try the vitamin thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You won't need to take what you're taking.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think I just threw my bottle away because I was out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I've only had one other person out of a lot of people who had a reaction like that but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean it was, it was terrifying.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, as a matter of fact, it fits something I was reading, this is very complicated about the glutamate receptors.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh great, another receptor.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's very complicated but, well anyway, at this point, glutamate can act on these four different receptors and ketamine, if you take ketamine, it blocks this one and gives you a schizophrenic like psychosis, somehow that happened to you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You think I was schizophrenic psychosis.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah because it's just like PCP does it too, it makes people crazy, but PCP and ketamine are the same thing really.  Okay, so you must have been blocking this receptor, so we've got to stop doing that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, don't block that receptor for God's sake.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Theoretically, I could give you the folate and Lamictal, I don't know, and then here's another, it's not going to happen to you but if that receptor gets over stimulated, probably in schizophrenia or some other things, it then starts causing neural cell death.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh God.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This isn't everybody so, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well that's good, [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah but see how complicated it is.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know we were trying this for -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well gaba is over here, glutamate with another enzyme can become gaba and then there's gaba A and B receptors and the B ones, when they fire off, they inhibit other cells in the brain and so does this but this gaba A receptor is the one the benzos work on and alcohol works on.  I'm just beginning to kind of -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean this is, I mean I just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, this is bad news.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We were trying the gaba stuff back with dementia.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, I remember doing it too.  Okay, this is the super folate.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> How many mg is it?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This says 725 but it's -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a metabolite beyond folic acid.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It gets in the brain better, we just better do one of those for now.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I still have a little bit of Lexapro at home but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well truthfully you better come back pretty soon, like next week, you know, see if we can get some stability out of this.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is the worst I've, I mean, you know, I've been here and cried my heart out because of situational things but this has nothing to do with it, it's just, it's crazy.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not a case, whatever did happen with this will?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's all done.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Where you weren't supposed to do anything.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh we got it all done.  I've got a huge trust in my name.  He sold half of the [DEIDENTIFIED] stock and put it in my name and I've got a million in that one and I've got a couple other ones so money is not even an issue.  He's actually followed what I said all along about the money.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, after a big show.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, after -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> A few thousand to the lawyer.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then, I mean we got another lawyer who is a young woman with her father and I mean they just calmed [NAME OTHER] down and we put it into trust for the universities and for education and we've got a community trust fund for the arts and the homeless shelter.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's great.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that's all taken care of.  The money issue isn't even an issue anymore.  I mean I'm not even, that doesn't even affect my thinking, it's just -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No this is truly -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is craziness.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Chemical.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is craziness.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'd better give you, I expect when you wash the Lamictal out of your system, you know, that stuff should stop so it'll be a day or two.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But if it doesn't, I'm going to give you a couple, like Abilify, it's one of the major tranquilizers, because that should treat it until you get back in balance but I just don't know what the Lamictal did.  I've got one guy, he's a doctor, ironically an anesthesiologist and I think he messed up his brain with ketamine.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And he has weird reactions to everything I give him, unfortunately, the [DEIDENTIFIED] got a hold of him so now he's watched by them but he has a letter that says he's not a substance abuser.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh great, here's a nurse practitioner and a doctor and we can't -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'll just move him in over your house, maybe together you can figure it out because I can't.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Jesus.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you haven't been schizophrenic but you just had some pretty crazy dreams.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well and to go from just a total meltdown to all of the sudden going out and cleaning.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean that's bipolar stuff.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know that's bipolar but you don't do that in 4 hours.  I couldn't get out of bed yesterday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, some people do that, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I just laid there in bed, I couldn't move and then all the sudden I got this sudden burst of energy and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I saw a lady, she was depressed, she couldn't get out of bed, one shock treatment, the doctor that did the shock treatment said she woke up, jumped up off the table and was manic.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, well maybe I should get a shock treatment, I don't know.  I mean it's been a very stressful, I mean [NAME OTHER] tore up his knee and I've got this cancer stuff on my legs and there's been a whole bunch of, you know, I went to that funeral in [DEIDENTIFIED] so there's been a whole bunch of stuff but this is -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Still it shouldn't - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean this should not, I've been through more than this before.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's because we changed something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I've been under mini stresses.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well this should be far less than you had before.  This may make this work better.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So get off of the Lamictal totally or stay?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, just stop it, it's not, you can stop that, it's not something you have to go slowly.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You don't have to -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Decrease it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Because it's a seizure drug really.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's very strange, I'm sorry that happened.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's weird.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know, what a business this is.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, I mean to have the paranoia, I've never been paranoid.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know me, I'm never paranoid, I 'm always pissed at everybody, this is, oh, and I'm even halfway that during the day sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you have any panic attacks during the day?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean if I'm having it, if I'm laying down and can't get out of bed, then I'll have a panic attack but I've been trying to stay off the Xanax.  I mean I still take a Xanax to sleep, before I go to bed but I'm sure it isn't doing any good, I think it's just a placebo but - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So that's why I said, okay, I'll put the Xanax by my bed and if I have these dreams, I haven't taken it before I went to bed but I'm not going to lay there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I'd say go on and take it because it's inhibitory, it calms down other things.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So that'll be your main tranquilizer plus I'll give you some of those other but these newer, all three of the new antipsychotics and I did one study on one of them, have proven to be mood stabilizers.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> What are they?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well because they work on dopamine like the old ones but they also work on serotonin receptor, different ones, different serotonin receptors so, you know, they are doing something that no other drugs ever did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I probably have dead brain cells anyway.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's the other thing that I just read convincing articles about, in depression and schizophrenia, if you don't treat them and keep on treating them evidently, the nerve cells with either die or the dendrites will die so you might have a nerve cell but it doesn't have all its dendrites, you know, so it's - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've got a dementia then?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well - </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Drug induced dementia.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They said both of these illness are progressive neurodegenerative diseases but not to the point where you're going to end up demented evidently but we've always said, you know, if somebody had bipolar or schizophrenia a long time, they would start to lose IQ points, I mean that was kind of how we said it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I can, you know, when I look back, the bipolars that I have seen, they just get, you know - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sometimes stupid on you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They do, I mean they get blank.  I've seen bipolars that just have wild as hell, then all of the sudden they're just kind of like -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There's nothing.  I don't want to be that way.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No but we've kept you on the medicines basically a long time.  I mean we've done the right thing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, yeah, I've been on, I have been on Wellbutrin forever.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, well that should, you know, do it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I think the minute I came off of those tricyclics I went on, well I went on a few of those others but I couldn't take them, so then I went on Wellbutrin and I've stayed.  Every once in a while you've had to pump it up with something else</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, right.  Well, all right, don't get manic on me.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh God.  I mean [NAME OTHER] is just like what in the hell is wrong with you and I'm sitting there just sobbing.  I said I don't even know what I'm crying about.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well that's the main thing you came back in saying.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right.  Keep trying till we get it right, that's all I can tell you.  Seroquel 50, but I'm really saying use Xanax more.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, is that Seroquel?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That's what I'm going to give you just in case you keep having these crazy dreams.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well one of the side effects for Lamictal is - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Did you read? </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, weird dreams.  I mean it says - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I haven't had anybody get them so that's -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I will dream, you know, I've always but these are horrific.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They're nightmares.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean I've had nightmares but these are not nightmares even, these are like so true to life that I even wake up hating the people that are torturing me and it follows me along for half of the day until I get myself together and say -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All right, I put an article out there, that's why I asked you about that Chantix, that can do this.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And one guy got really crazy on it evidently but then I went back and I asked my son because him and his friends are the ones I gave it to first.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And they never told me about the damn dreams.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> They said they were having dreams about homosexual relationships and crazy shit, these are lineman for the county.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh geez.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I said why didn't you tell me, you know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well I haven't had those kind of dreams, I just dream of people in my past that I know are out to get me and it's like because I can't, the main thing that bothers me is I'm not able to accomplish what they want me to do.  I mean that's probably my whole story in my life anyway, you know that, but these dreams are about I'm striving and striving and striving and every time I get shut down.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well our job is to give people what they need not what they want.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So in the dream you tell them that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I know, well you know me with my nurturing soul.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But this is, I've always said screw it if I didn't want to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well it kind of proves I guess that a lot of what you did was to get people to accept you, like you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you didn't do it, so now they're coming after you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You know.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I mean this probably is very true.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> We'll get you out of it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've spent my whole life doing that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, just try this, get this going and let's see.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You probably ought to come back Monday or Tuesday or something so we can get this right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If I'm not schizophrenic or demented - </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You won't be.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or whatever the hell I can be.  I mean I went out yesterday and I came back and I looked at myself in the mirror and I said I look just like a crazy lady, I mean just my whole persona looked crazy.  My hair was all, I really thought I belong in a nut house.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I thought I'm not going.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The average stay is only three days, so you might as well go to the beach.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I've been there, I've worked there too long to go and be there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well it'll be interesting to see what they make of this.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it'll be very.</p>

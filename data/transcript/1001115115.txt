<P><b>Session Transcript</b></P>

<P>TH 1: So, Lorne and Kathy, I am really glad that you chose to do this tonight, and in talking up to now you've told me that you've been in therapy for a while and that it seems to be helping, and you have a couple of kids, and that's about all I know. So, how can I be helpful to you tonight do you think?</p>
<P>M 1: Well, you could be helpful to us by enlightening us upon the information and knowledge that you might have to enhance our relationship.</p>
<P>TH 2: Okay. How about for you? Is there anything more specific than that?</P>
<P>F 1: I'd like to talk about how the things that really bother me in my marriage, how they may relate to my childhood or how I raise my children. I think that it's playing a big part just by the therapy that I was in, things that are coming up for me from my childhood.</p>
<P>TH 3: From your childhood?</P>
<P>F 2: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 4: Well, let's start with what you started with which are things about the marriage that bother you. Can you give me a couple of those?</P>
<P>F 3: Yeah, I could give you a couple of those. There are some that are right on the tip of my tongue. My husband and I have this ongoing problem with our home and who takes care of the home . . .</P>
<P>TH 5: [Uh hmn]</P>
<P>F 4: And we basically are pretty traditional. He takes out the garbage, I do the dishes. We are a very traditional couple. However, when it comes to maybe yard work, things like that, he really doesn't want any part of it where I would think this is a traditional role. You should do it. But it's not important to him, so it would go for weeks on end, and it's something that I've touched on in my own therapy that because I grew up in an environment where things were not neat, and it was embarrassing to me as a child, it is very important to me. I always thought that when I grow up I'm going to have a nice house, and I'm going to have nice things, and when it doesn't happen for me, I'm grown up now, but it's not happening for me. And I blame him for that, and I, and I feel a knot in my stomach every time I'm cutting the grass and things are not looking the way I would want them to look, and I'm not getting any help. So . . .</p>
<P>TH 6: So, you've got the knot in your stomach, and then what happens after that? What do you do?</p>
<P>F 5: Um, usually nag about probably something else but not getting in touch with what's really bothering me, so it will be nagging at something else. So, he'll come home from skiing, and I'll think that it's because he went skiing that I'm mad. I'm sure there is a tie-in like hey, maybe you should have helped me before you went skiing, or, ah, so, that's where I am.</p>
<P>TH 7: So, you'll complain somehow to Lorne about something that you think is probably not related but seems important at the time?</p>
<P>F 6: Right.</P>
<P>TH 8: And when Kathy does that, what do you wind up doing?</P>
<P>M 2: Ah, probably saying why are you whining? What's the real problem?Let's take it to a deeper level. We've had some therapy and we've had some information that's helped us a lot. We are working on what's really the issue. You know, it's not just why aren't you cutting the grass, but, ah, so . . .</p>
<P>TH 9: So you'll say Wait a minute, what's really going on here. Is that right?</P>
<P>M 3: Yeah. Yeah. I started out to say why are you whining? Why are you crabbing and bitching, and now we are able to go a little deeper and get the real answers and real problems on the table.</P>
<P>TH 10: So before you would get defensive and angry and yell back or something?</P>
<P>M 4: Yeah. Now I know there is something underlying besides Why aren't you cutting the grass?</P>
<P>TH 11: Okay, does that sound right to you?</P>
<P>F 7: Yes. However, ah . . .</P>
<P>M 5: What? Is that bothering you?</P>
<P>F 8: Yeah, you're shoes are squeaking. Ah . . .</P>
<P>TH 12: Is there something underlying bothering you?</P>
<P>M 6: Why does it bother you that my shoes are squeaking?</P>
<P>F 9: Um, because I know that we're on tape, and I know that the mike is picking it up. You know, I had some experience with this stuff.</P>
<P>TH 13: That's a good underlying reason.</P>
<P>M 7: I was going to wear my work clothes here because I'm pretty comfortable, but she thought it was a bad idea.</P>
<P>F 10: So, anyway, it irritates me when he does that, when he says what's the deeper level. What's the deeper level? Ah . . .</P>
<P>TH 14: It feels like he is trying to be your therapist or something?</P>
<P>F 11: Yeah, it's irritating, and sometimes I can't get in touch with the deeper level. I don't have that expertise at that time, and it's irritating when he will ask me that.</P>
<P>TH 15: So, when you get irritated by that, what do you wind up doing?</P>
<P>F 12: Turning it out. Maybe just changing the subject or going to read a bookor flip the TV on.</P>
<P>TH 16: So then . . .</P>
<P>F 13: Then I realize, I'm sorry . . . Then I realize that it's, I cannot think what the deeper problem is, and he doesn't want to discuss the little issue that I brought up, and I realize that we are at a dead lock, and I wait to go to therapy at the end of the week.</p>
<P>TH 17: Uhuh, so, you'll have a kind of cold war until then, at least a distance for a while?</p>
<P>F 14: Yeah.</P>
<P>M 8: And that stinks because I feed off of love and compassion and a lot of times I have to wait until the issue gets on the table in therapy to get the answers before I feel some love and compassion. I need that.</P>
<P>TH 18: So.</P>
<P>M 9: It's really big for me.</P>
<P>TH 19: So, when Kathy kind of shuts you out that way, what happens to youLorne at that point, what happens inside of you?</P>
<P>M 10: Um, I get angry. Ah, I get defensive. Ah, I start looking at other women. Ah, let's see . . .</p>
<P>TH 20: Has that been an issue in your relationship?</p>
<P>F 15: Yes it has.</p>
<P>TH 21: Okay. Is it still, or not so much?</p>
<P>F 16: Um, I think that, I think it's not brought up, but it's something that I think about, that I think that he's capable of if he were unhappy.</p>
<P>TH 22: So, you worry sometimes about whether or not he's happy enough or making him too unhappy that he might start doing that again?</p>
<P>F 17: Right, right.</p>
<P>TH 23: Okay, okay. So when you feel cut off like that, it triggers a lot of emotion it wounds like.</p>
<P>F 18: Yeah, a lot.</p>
<P>TH 24: And then there's a part of you that starts to think well if she's not going to be there for me, I'll find somebody else? Something like that?</p>
<P>M 11: Well, I do, my eyes wander more than when I'm happy.</P>
<P>TH 25: Okay.</P>
<P>M 12: And that cutting off brings me back to my childhood.</P>
<P>TH 26: I see.</P>
<P>M 13: I was cut off as a child by my brothers and sisters. So, it's kind of like a double whammy.</P>
<P>TH 27: So, it feels like you're stuck back there again?</P>
<P>M 14: Right.</P>
<P>TH 28: So, whenever you see this cold part of Kathy, the one that really can shut you out it triggers this part of you that feels so desperately alone and lonely and cut off. Is that right?</P>
<P>M 15: Yes.</P>
<P>TH 29: And then that triggers a part of you that start looking around, got to find somebody to take care of this, this loneliness.</P>
<P>M 16: Well, you know, I'm not living in a happy zone, and it just, you know, creates different feelings</P>
<P>TH 30: Okay. So, how would it be for you Lorne if, if even when this cold part of her came out you didn't feel that so much. So bad, you didn't feel so . . .</P>
<P>M 17: How would that feel? That would feel great.</P>
<P>TH 31: That would be something you would like?</P>
<P>M 18: That would feel great. That would feel very warm and that would feel good.</P>
<P>TH 32: I mean even if she were cold, you could take care of that yourself. That would feel better to you?</P>
<P>M 19: If she was cold? I don't understand the question.</P>
<P>TH 33: Yeah. So, if she got irritated and cut you off, and instead of feeling so lonely and being pulled back into your past, you just said to yourself well, she's in that part. I'll just give her some space, and I'll be okay, and it didn't have this big . . .</P>
<P>M 20: I'm trying to work on that rejection piece of me that was in my childhood that when I feel it I can, you know, pull that aside, that rejection aside, and work on that feeling in a more mature way.</P>
<P>TH 34: Okay. And how's that been going?</P>
<P>M 21: It's been going pretty good. Yeah, I like it. What?</P>
<P>F 19: Nothing.</P>
<P>M 22: This is something new to her because I went to therapy by myself in the last session, and I got a lot of insight and information.</P>
<P>TH 35: So this is pretty new.</P>
<P>M 23: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 36: This thing you are trying to do here.</P>
<P>F 19: You said how does that feel, well, it's been two days.</P>
<P>TH 37: So, you are waiting to see the results here?</P>
<P>F 20: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 38: Okay, okay. So you get cold and withdraw and wait for the therapy<BR>session to start?</P>
<P>F 21: Yes.</P>
<P>M 24: When we should be working on it. You know, that withdrawing and being cold should be a little bit in the past because I feel we are a little bit above and beyond that, so . . .</P>
<P>F 22: But I can't turn my emotions on and off like he would like me to.</P>
<P>TH 39: Yeah.</P>
<P>F 23: I think that he came from a kind of family where everything is good all<BR>the time. You know, you don't talk about these things.</P>
<P>TH 40: I see.</P>
<P>F 24: We are okay. And you know if you have problems you certainly don't discuss it. You bury it. And how I'm feeling in this relationship is that I can't have normal human emotions. That's not okay, you know. I've learned to hide them, bury them, because hey, people are happy all the time. What is the problem? What's your problem?</P>
<P>TH 41: So there's a part of Lorne that, that says that when he sees . . .</P>
<P>F 25: Oh yeah. Oh sure.</P>
<P>TH 42: That he picked up from his family.</P>
<P>F 26: Sure. He carries that persona.</P>
<P>TH 43: Okay, would you agree with that Lorne?</P>
<P>M 25: Yeah. I saw a lot of that. Don't talk about issues. Just bury everything with work, food, you know, stuff like that.</p>
<P>TH 44: So you would agree that when Kathy gets upset somehow that that triggers that part of you?</p>
<P>M 26: Um, I, I, I feel we are a little bit above and beyond that. We've been keeping the lines of communication pretty open, and, you know, things are better. I, I feel they are. She, obviously we are not on the same page quite yet.</p>
<P>F 27: No.</p>
<P>TH 45: So, you would say that, that you still get more of that than you would like?</p>
<P>F 28: Yeah. I'll just give you a little example, I knew something was bothering me, so I thought I'll do a fast, and I won't use food anymore to cover what I'm feeling. A little experiment I was doing. So, I warned him. I'm not going to be real pleasant this week, because I'm trying to get in touch with something and just bear with me. Well, by about the second day, you know, you know, he couldn't, you know, continue that. He was just like well what's your problem. What's the real problem? Well, I was trying to find it, you know, you know, and I needed that space. But, so I don't really think that we are on that same page he is talking about when . . .</p>
<P>TH 46: Okay, but that's a little different.</P>
<P>F 29: Whenever I get in touch with . . .</P>
<P>TH 47: So you feel like it's hard for you to have some space or privacy?</P>
<P>F 30: Just some time to be in those feelings.</P>
<P>TH 48: Okay.</P>
<P>F 31: In a bad feeling. Trying to get to the bottom of why I'm feeling a certain way.</P>
<P>TH 49: Okay.</P>
<P>F 32: And he wants it fixed immediately. And it's not always possible.</P>
<P>TH 50: Okay.</P>
<P>F 33: So, I'm wondering if I'm putting on some sort of a little happy act just to pacify him so I can really figure it out on my own, or . . .</P>
<P>TH 51: Okay. So, you've gotten to the point where you feel like you aren't real a lot of the time it sounds like.</P>
<P>F 34: Oh yeah.</P>
<P>TH 52: Okay.</P>
<P>F 35: Right, because of this situation we talked about. Because he came from a place of everything is okay all the time. So, I put myself in that everything's okay when I'm maybe around him.</P>
<P>M 27: You've also said that you wear a lot of masks and, and you know, you don't want to wear those masks anymore.</P>
<P>F 36: Right.</P>
<P>TH 53: So, that's just what I was going to ask Lorne. So, it sounds like Lorne is saying he is working on trying to be more available and less reactive to you, and it doesn't sound like you believe he is totally there yet, but it also sounds like it's still really hard for you to trust that and to, to let your guard down.</P>
<P>F 37: Right.</P>
<P>TH 54: Okay.</P>
<P>F 38: Right.</P>
<P>TH 55: So, do you think that you probably could do more than you are but you are still a little bit afraid to? Or . . .</P>
<P>F 39: I don't feel I have the safe place to do that, no.</P>
<P>TH 56: What are you . . .</P>
<P>F 40: I feel safe when I go to therapy. That's why everything comes out there. That's why I wait until the end of the week. I feel a sense of safety there that I don't have at home.</P>
<P>TH 57: Okay. And what do you think would happen if you were more real? What kind of danger?</p>
<P>F 41: He would be unhappy.</p>
<P>TH 58: And what would be bad about that?</p>
<P>F 42: Um, he may wander.</p>
<P>TH 59: Ah. So this wandering part of Lorne is . . .</P>
<P>F 43: Is very real.</P>
<P>TH 60: Is a big heavy weight and it keeps you in fear.</P>
<P>F 44: It's very real.</P>
<P>TH 61: Okay. Okay. And you're smiling.</P>
<P>M 28: It's, uh, this has been going on. She's been saying how she in therapy how she doesn't like to live with these masks on and she wants to take them all off and be herself, but I'm waiting for that. And, she is saying that she is going to probably it's going to make me unhappy, and I'm curious as to what it is. That's why I'm smiling.</p>
<P>TH 62: Okay. We've maybe half an hour left, and there are number of different possibilities in terms of what we can do. I've heard about a number of different parts of each of you so far. Like there is a part of you that looks around at other women, and there is this piece of you that gets so lonely and scared when you get cutoff, and there is some anger you talked about earlier too. And then for you there's the one that cuts him off. And, also a part of you that tries to pretend like everything's okay to placate him so he doesn't get upset. And I also can here there is an angry part of you about that and, and about having to live with the fear of him wandering. Does that sound right?</p>
<P>F 44: Yeah, it does.</p>
<P>TH 63: Okay. All right. Now there's ways I have of helping people with these parts so that they are not in their way quite so much or to find out at least what is going on that they keep popping up. And there are also ways that when you want to talk to each other directly, I can help you keep it yourselves rather than these different parts pumping in. Do you follow what I'm saying?</p>
<P>F 45: Yes.</p>
<P>TH 64: So there is a kind of connection between you even when you talk about difficult issues. Do you have a sense of which you would rather do in the next twenty-five minutes?</p>
<P>F 46: I'll let you talk.</p>
<P>M 29: Any help is, anything, like I say, the best thing that you can give us, for me anyway, is the information to enhance our relationship.</p>
<P>TH 65: Okay. How about you Kathy?</P>
<P>F 47: I'll go along with whatever the feeling of the best way to go here is.</P>
<P>TH 66: Okay. How would it feel to actually talk to each other about an issue right now?</P>
<P>M 30: Talk about what issue?</P>
<P>TH 67: Whatever issue feels pressing to you right now.</P>
<P>F 48: Let's talk about that one, because that one is nice and pressing.</P>
<P>M 31: Which one? The grass?</P>
<P>F 49: How bout the grass looks greener on the other side, maybe that one.</P>
<P>TH 68: The wandering part?</P>
<P>F 50: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 69: Okay. All right then we will start with that. Is that okay with you?</P>
<P>M 32: It's fine. I'll roll with it.</P>
<P>TH 70: And will you give me permission when I see these parts of you starting to pop up as you talk to each other about this, to blow the whistle and stop the action and have you each get them to step back so you can . . .</P>
<P>M 33: Take a step back?</P>
<P>TH 71: Yeah, some of these emotions that get in your way, to step back a little bit so you can hang in there with each other.</P>
<P>M 34: All right.</P>
<P>TH 72: Do I have that permission?</P>
<P>F 51: Sure.</P>
<P>TH 73: It's okay with you?</P>
<P>F 52: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 74: Okay. All right. So, you're the one that brought it up. Do you want to begin?</p>
<P>F 53: All right. And how would you like me to do that?</p>
<P>TH 75: I'd like you to just begin to talk about the way you feel about that part of Lorne. The effect it has on you, and Lorne I'd like you just, the best you can, to listen.</p>
<P>M 35: Okay.</p>
<P>TH 76: Okay.</p>
<P>F 54: What, at, that effects me I guess a lot deeper than I even thought. These things, just this whole situation here, going on to that subject. It's something we haven't even touched on in therapy is interesting to me. Why now, but, ah, I think that maybe that's why I am finding it hard to be totally myself because what if totally myself, ah, wouldn't make you happy. And if you are not happy, I know what happens when you are not happy.</p>
<P>M 36: Well, would you like to try it?</P>
<P>F 55: I don't feel that safety. I don't feel that sense of safety.</P>
<P>M 37: Right now you don't feel safe?</P>
<P>F 56: No, I don't feel safe.</P>
<P>TH 77: Right now, Kathy, you don't feel safe?</P>
<P>F 57: Oh, right now I feel safe, talking.</P>
<P>TH 78: You mean at home.</P>
<P>F 58: Just in my life in general. So, I seem to have this sense of safety when I have . . .</P>
<P>TH 79: A third party around.</P>
<P>F 59: A third party to basically hold my hand in it. I feel that sense of safety.</P>
<P>M 38: And feel vulnerable at home and a little insecure that you can't be yourself, and, ah, you would like to have that in our relationship?</P>
<P>F 60: I'm wondering if it's that I can't be myself or that I don't feel real safe. What I'm feeling right now is a sense that I don't feel safe and also, ah, I'm wondering if, ah, I'm feeling maybe you, if you're having a hard time, even if it<BR>didn't relate to me, then I don't feel safe. If something is happening in your life, and if things are not going well, if things are . . .</P>
<P>TH 80: So even if you were perfect . . .</P>
<P>F 61: Even if I were perfect, I'm feeling that, I'm feeling helpless.</P>
<P>TH 81: You are worried about that part of him.</P>
<P>F 62: Yeah. Just things in life that happen. Just things in life. The birth of our children was too much. When things get too much, he . . .</P>
<P>TH 82: He wanders.</P>
<P>F 63: Yeah. And I'm thinking that the reason why I don't feel safe is because a life is long and lot's of things happen in your life. You go through many stages, and, ah . . .</P>
<P>TH 83: Okay. Take a second now, and as you have been thinking about this,<BR>talking about this, I'd like you to just focus in on your body and see where this part<BR>of you that's so afraid seems to be in your body.</P>
<P>F 64: Mhm, I'm, I'm feeling it here. I'm feeling it in what would that be your third schrocral (?). What holds. What's there.</P>
<P>TH 84: Well, don't try to think about it right now. I'd like you to focus down there for a second.</P>
<P>F 65: All right. Ah . . .</P>
<P>TH 85: Just focus your attention down in that, that fearful part of you down there. Okay?</p>
<P>F 66: Yes. It seems to be resonating right here.</P>
<P>TH 86: And how are you feeling toward that part of you?</P>
<P>F 67: Ah, it feels, it feels closed.</P>
<P>TH 87: Uhuh.</P>
<P>F 68: It doesn't feel open.</P>
<P>TH 88: How do you feel toward it?</P>
<P>F 69: How do I feel toward it?</P>
<P>TH 89: Mmh.</P>
<P>F 70: Ah, almost like a fight.</P>
<P>TH 90: Like you are fighting it?</P>
<P>F 71: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 91: Okay. Could you find the part of you that's trying to fight it?</P>
<P>F 72: It's right here.</P>
<P>TH 92: And ask it to step back for a second.</P>
<P>F 73: Okay.</P>
<P>TH 93: Okay?</P>
<P>F 74: Mhm.</P>
<P>TH 94: And how to you feel toward it now, down in there?</p>
<P>F 75: The fight is a little less.</P>
<P>TH 95: Yeah?</P>
<P>F 76: A little less, yeah. I don't know if it's because I opened my eyes or, but the fight seems a little less.</P>
<P>TH 96: Okay, and how are you feeling toward that fear in your gut?</P>
<P>F 77: It seems to be okay. It seems to be okay if I remove my head.</P>
<P>TH 97: All right.</P>
<P>F 78: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 98: And ask that scared part in there what it wants you to say for it right now to Lorne or to let you let it take over. Let's see what it needs to say, either to you or to him.</P>
<P>F 79: Ah, it, it wants to open up. It's, it's saying please don't be afraid and just let me open up.</P>
<P>TH 99: Yeah, yeah. Okay.</P>
<P>F 80: It feels afraid.</P>
<P>TH 100: It's afraid right now?</P>
<P>F 81: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 101: Is that okay?</P>
<P>F 82: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 102: It's okay. Can you see this part of you right now?</P>
<P>F 83: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 103: What's it look like?</P>
<P>F 84: Like a little girl.</P>
<P>TH 104: Now how old would you say?</P>
<P>F 85: About eight.</P>
<P>TH 105: Eight. And how do you feel toward her right now? You are feeling her feelings, huh? Is that okay?</P>
<P>F 86: Yeah, it's okay.</P>
<P>TH 106: Okay. How do you feel toward her though?</P>
<P>F 87: How do I feel towards her?</P>
<P>TH 107: Yeah.</P>
<P>F 88: I feel sad for her.</P>
<P>TH 108: Can you show her that you feel sad for her, you feel sorry for her?</P>
<P>F 89: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 109: How does she react?</P>
<P>F 90: Comforted.</P>
<P>TH 110: Good. She's feeling better?</P>
<P>F 91: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 111: That's good. It's okay that Lorne helps you that way?</P>
<P>F 92: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 112: Okay good. But she's got a lot of fear, huh?</P>
<P>F 93: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 113: Okay.</P>
<P>F 94: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 114: Yeah. Do you understand why she is so frightened?</P>
<P>F 95: Because she doesn't trust.</P>
<P>TH 115: Yeah.</P>
<P>F 96: She doesn't trust.</P>
<P>TH 116: No?</P>
<P>F 97: No.</P>
<P>TH 117: And she doesn't even trust you?</P>
<P>F 98: She trusts me.</P>
<P>TH 118: She does.</P>
<P>F 99: But that's why she is afraid because she doesn't trust.</P>
<P>TH 119: I see. Okay.</P>
<P>F 100: She doesn't feel supported.</P>
<P>TH 120: Ah. By the people around her?</P>
<P>F 101: Yeah. She just doesn't trust. She doesn't trust, and she doesn't trust in the, in the people around her, she doesn't trust the universe, she just doesn't trust.</P>
<P>TH 121: But she does trust you right now.</P>
<P>F 102: She, she's learning to. She's learning to because she didn't trust me.</P>
<P>TH 122: She didn't before? No.</P>
<P>F 103: No.</P>
<P>TH 123: Okay, but she can trust you a little bit now?</P>
<P>F 104: A little.</P>
<P>TH 124: And are you still, are you touching her, or what are you doing?</P>
<P>F 105: (Sobbing)</P>
<P>TH 125: What's happening now Kathy?</P>
<P>F 106: She has gone off.</P>
<P>TH 126: She did?</P>
<P>F 107: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 127: How come?</P>
<P>F 108: She left. I believe it got too scary.</P>
<P>TH 128: Did it? Okay. Do you want to see if she'll come . . .</P>
<P>F 109: As soon as, as soon as outside forces, you know, as soon as I pay attention to what's going on around me, ah, I lose the contact.</P>
<P>TH 129: Okay.</P>
<P>F 110: I lose the connection.</P>
<P>TH 130: Okay. Okay. How are you feeling right now?</P>
<P>F 111: I'm feeling okay.</P>
<P>TH 131: You okay?</P>
<P>F 112: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 132: See if she'll come back just for a second, just long enough, and then we could find out a little more of what she would like from Lorne if she's up for talking about that.</P>
<P>F 113: There's something that maybe I need to address because, ah, what happens is, what happens is when I'm getting really in touch with that I always let outside influences come in, and then I worry about things like my grass. I worry about is my makeup running, and it throws me away from . . .</P>
<P>TH 133: So you get distracted.</P>
<P>F 114: I get distracted. Right. And I think that was, it was the . . .</P>
<P>TH 134: That's what happened?</P>
<P>F 115: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 135: See if you can find the part that distracted you.</P>
<P>F 116: That part of how I appear?</P>
<P>TH 136: Yeah, where is that one in your body?</P>
<P>F 117: That one's low.</P>
<P>TH 137: So focus on it and, ah, just tell it that you understand it's trying to protect you, but see if it is willing to step back also and let that little girl come back for a second. Not for a real long time, but just for a little while.</P>
<P>F 118: Okay.</P>
<P>TH 138: Okay is she back?</P>
<P>[PAUSE]</P>
<P>F 119: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 139: Okay. And how are you relating to her right now?</P>
<P>F 120: I'm, ah, trying to get a real strong feeling there again.</P>
<P>TH 140: Okay.</P>
<P>F 121: Feeling safety.</P>
<P>TH 141: Trying to help her feel safe?</P>
<P>F 122: Mhm.</P>
<P>TH 142: Is it working at all?</P>
<P>F 123: Just a little.</P>
<P>TH 143: A little bit? Okay. Maybe you can ask her how you can help her feel safer right now. What would help?</P>
<P>[PAUSE]</P>
<P>TH 144: Are you getting anything?</P>
<P>F 124: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 145: What's she saying?</P>
<P>F 125: She said stop trying to please everybody else and just take care of me.</P>
<P>TH 146: Okay. And what do you say to that?</P>
<P>F 126: I agreed.</P>
<P>TH 147: Did you? Is that something you really think you could do, at least try to do? Yeah. Does that help her hear that you are going to try and do that? Yeah. Good. What's happening now Kathy?</P>
<P>F 127: I am just making that connection with myself and leting me be there. And then . . .</P>
<P>TH 148: Good. That feels good? Okay.</P>
<P>F 128: Just feel a real strong connection right now.</P>
<P>TH 149: And it feels good?</P>
<P>F 129: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 150: That's great.</P>
<P>[PAUSE]</P>
<P>TH 151: So, it's real hard for her to trust?</P>
<P>F 130: Oh yeah.</P>
<P>TH 152: So she carries a lot of feelings about that part of Lorne.</P>
<P>F 131: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 153: Is that right?</P>
<P>F 132: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 154: That part has hurt her a lot, huh? Yeah.</P>
<P>[PAUSE]</P>
<P>TH 155: But how would it be if you really could take better care of her so that she didn't even if, even if Lorne's part popped up at some point, she didn't feel quite so much like she'd lose everything because you'd still be there. What would that be like?</P>
<P>F 133: Well, she is starting to believe that. . .</P>
<P>TH 156: Is she?</P>
<P>F 134: A little more.</P>
<P>TH 157: Yeah?</P>
<P>F 135: Yeah. But first I had to straighten out myself first before she . . .</P>
<P>TH 158: Okay.</P>
<P>[PAUSE]</P>
<P>TH 159: What's happening now?</P>
<P>F 136: I don't know. I'm just sad right now that I've been gone so long. I feel a sense of coming home.</P>
<P>TH 160: That's great. That's great.</P>
<P>[PAUSE]</P>
<P>TH 161: Is it okay if I ask Lorne a question?</P>
<P>F 137: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 162: So, what's happening for you, Lorne?</P>
<P>M 39: I know how that feels, and I want her to have that.</P>
<P>TH 163: So you feel happy for . . .</P>
<P>M 40: It's why we're going through therapy.</P>
<P>TH 164: So you are feeling good about this?</P>
<P>M 41: Yes, I'm feeling good.</P>
<P>TH 165: Good. So, it sound like if you, if you can work on that wandering part some more, that would help this little girl, huh?</P>
<P>M 42: I know. I know that she doesn't trust me, and, ah, that's why she carries her guard up. And, ah . . .</P>
<P>TH 166: And you can understand her?</P>
<P>M 43: Oh, yeah. I realize that. I broke her heart before, and, and ah, that's why she is afraid to let her guard down.</P>
<P>TH 167: Okay. Is there something you want to tell her about that?</P>
<P>M 44: I want her to believe in me and, ah, and, ah, trust in me so that she can feel that sense of coming home and feel that good feeling.</P>
<P>TH 168: Good. Can you do that?</P>
<P>M 45: Can you do that?</P>
<P>F 138: I'm working on it.</P>
<P>TH 169: Yeah. I mean it seems to me that that wandering part of you is still around trying to help you and protect you in different ways, and while that's still the case, it's pretty hard for Lorne to, for Kathy to really say I can do that. Does that sound right to you Kathy?</P>
<P>F 139: Yeah. Right.</P>
<P>TH 170: So, and usually, I can just tell you from my experience, those wandering parts are really trying to protect the part of you that feels so, you know, so abandoned and scared.</P>
<P>M 46: I'm working on that piece of me that when I get rejected . . .</P>
<P>TH 171: Yeah.</P>
<P>M 47: I've learned how to deal with that.</P>
<P>TH 172: Yeah, so once you get that on top of that, I think it will be a lot easier.</P>
<P>M 48: Yeah, I think that's a big, that's going to be really big for me.</P>
<P>TH 173: I do too.</P>
<P>M 49: And, ah, I think it's a big step forward.</P>
<P>TH 174: Yeah, but until then it's probably fair that Kathy keeps, you know, taking care of this little girl herself.</P>
<P>M 50: Absolutely.</P>
<P>TH 175: And maybe not, you know, look to you quite so much.</P>
<P>M 51: Right. Exactly.</P>
<P>TH 176: Does that sound okay?</P>
<P>M 52: Yes. That sounds great. I'm all for it.</P>
<P>TH 177: How does that sound to you, Kathy?</P>
<P>F 140: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 178: Okay. We don't have a lot of time left, and it's been pretty emotional. So, I just wanted to check and see if there is anything more that you wanted to say about what you've just been through or that you want to say to Lorne or . . .</P>
<P>F 141: There is something I'd like to say on that. That, ah, when you mentioned Can you do that? You know, it's almost like, can you do that right now? And no I can't right now. I need to, I need to see that you're dealing with that, you know . . .</P>
<P>M 53: Rejection piece?</P>
<P>F 142: Yeah.</P>
<P>M 54: Okay.</P>
<P>F 143: That you're solid with that and you've grown with that and that . . .</P>
<P>TH 179: Good.</P>
<P>F 144: you really have a handle on it, because I really right now I don't and that's not something that I can do . . .</P>
<P>M 55: I understand.</P>
<P>F 145: right away. Okay you have the information, now use it.</P>
<P>M 56: Okay.</P>
<P>TH 180: So that's okay with you?</P>
<P>M 57: Sure.</P>
<P>TH 181: I have a feeling, given what you guys said earlier, that if Kathy sticks to this, there will be times when it will be hard for you because you will feel . . .</P>
<P>M 58: It will be hard for me.</P>
<P>TH 182: abandoned and you will be pulling on her. So . . .</P>
<P>M 59: But it's going to be good for myself though too.</P>
<P>F 146: Yeah</P>
<P>M 60: Not only for us but for me too. It's not only just for our relationship, but it's important for myself. I was pushed as a child like that, so I think I can, I can do that easily, work on that.</P>
<P>TH 183: Okay. It may be harder than you think.</P>
<P>M 61: I'll, ah, give it a good stab.</P>
<P>TH 183: Okay, good. Okay. I'm not sure how much time we have left. Is there anything you want to know from me, or, ah, before we stop?</P>
<P>F 147: When you were, when you were asking about moving those parts aside, that's something that when something is really bothering us we, we just do that on our own. We can just stop and say . . . we . . .</P>
<P>TH 184: It's hard to do it on your own.</P>
<P>F 148: It's hard to do it on your own. It's nothing something that you would . . .</P>
<P>TH 185: It takes practice, but after you get to the point where you know it pretty well, you catch them early, then you can do it. I would say, I would warn you against trying to do anything to each other. You know earlier we talked about how you try to be Kathy's therapist and what's going on, and it's fine to talk about your own parts, but I would at this point advise you not to talk about each other at all. Keep that up to the other person. Does that sound fair?</P>
<P>M 62: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 185: Okay. Well, I think we are going to have to wrap.</P>
<P>M 63: Yeah.</P>
<P>TH 186: But, I really appreciate your coming in, and I've really enjoyed my time with you.</P>
<P>M 64: Thank you. Thank you very much.</P>
<P>TH 187: Yeah. I wish you a lot of luck, and, ah, you're in good hands.</P>
<P>M 65: Thanks. I appreciate it.</P>
<P>F 149: Thank you.</P>
<P>TH 188: You're welcome.</P>

<P>In future sessions, Schwartz would continue to work with the wife's parts to help her gain release from her fears and become more real. He would also work with the husband and his parts, particularly the wanderer part. The goal would be for each member of the couple to achieve an harmonious internal system that would allow for external harmony. This couple went on to work with a family therapist trained in the IFS model.</p>

<center><b>MIND-BODY THERAPY<br>
with<br>
Ernest Rossi, PhD</b></center>

<center><p><b>Introduction</b></p></center>

<p>Advances in neuroscience confirm the importance of the mind-body connection. Ernest Rossi brings to light important new research indicating that the brain is constantly growing and changing, and, with this, the profound realization that our mind and its responses can also change. In this session, Dr. Rossi works with Robin, who says she is constantly analyzing but doesn't know how to imagine. Dr. Rossi endeavors to elicit a sense of wonder in Robin, leading her in mind-body exercises that challenge her to think in new ways. In so doing, Robin uncovers a belief that she always needs to have control, as well as a previously unknown desire to find some mental peace and quiet. </p>

<p>This session includes key components of Mind-Body Therapy, including examining symptoms as mind-body signals that need attention, and helping clients navigate between social constraints and their own creativity. Note Dr. Rossi's therapy style, including how he asks basic accessing questions to tap into a client's mind-body connection.</p>

<p>Prior to the session between Dr. Rossi and the client, Robin, there is an enlightening discussion on the approach with therapists Jon Carlson and Diane Kjos.</p>

<center><b>Rossi's Approach</b></center>

<p>Carlson: Diane, can we talk a little bit about mind-body therapy?</p>

<p>Kjos: As I understand it, it's based on psychobiology, connecting how we feel with our body or our physical well-being, in a sense. I think that the other thing, though, that's interesting about it is that mind-body therapists often use hypnosis in their practice.</p>

<p>Carlson: So the body, the mind...It sounds really different from the other theories that we've studied so far. It's my understanding that symptoms are used, and symptoms often provide the direction for needed change. How does this compare to some of the other theories?</p>

<p>Kjos: You know, that's a tough question. It probably compares with any kind of theory that links thinking and feeling, or feeling and doing, and of course that would pretty much include everything. I think that it's an emerging force in therapy. It's somewhat different from some of the things we've seen before. And it also harks back to sort of the natural healing of earlier cultures. </p>

<p>Carlson: Oh, boy. This sounds likes it really is very comprehensive. Let's bring out our guest, Ernie Rossi, and learn some more about this important theory. Welcome, Dr. Rossi. Thank you.</p>

<p>Kjos: Welcome.</p>

<p>Carlson: Diane and I have been talking, and just trying to find out just what is mind-body therapy? Can you help us? Can you tell us?</p>

<p>Ernie Rossi: It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay. Can you tell us kind of in a nutshell what...</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. In a nutshell, it's the basic idea that mind and body obviously communicate. We're trying to break through the Descartian separation of mind and body. In my work in particular, I've been exploring the pathway of information flow from mind all the way down to genes and back. The main idea that's very exciting to me is that the mind is continually growing, and that's happening actually at the cellular level.</p>

<p>Carlson: That's encouraging.</p>

<p>Rossi: Very encouraging.</p>

<p>Carlson: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rossi: Up to now we've had this prejudice that other cells of the body divide and grow but the brain cells do not. But as early as 25 years ago, we learned that with new learning, enriched environments, proteins are formed in the brain. Just last week, an article came out in Nature showing that not only proteins but certain cells and the hippocampus of the brain that's related to memory and learning actually grow and divide. So this is a profoundly new implication for our work.</p>

<p>Carlson: It's a holistic theory, then, which uses the mind and the body together.</p>

<p>Rossi: Absolutely holistic</p>

<p>Carlson: But I'm still not sure. Can you...How do you do therapy with that?</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. If your basic premise is that the mind is always growing, then you have the idea that psychological problems are due to blocks or learned limitations in the learning process. My job as a mind-body therapist is to evoke a sense of wonder, a sense of exploration, a sense of helping people find where they got off track and where they can introduce something new in their lives so their brains can actually grow, as they learn new patterns of behavior. </p>

<p>Carlson: So it's sort of a learning theory.</p>

<p>Rossi: It is, absolutely, the essence of a learning theory, but much broader than the learning theories of the past, because we encompass all the holistic traditions in many, many cultures. Most cultures have ways of doing this, whether it's trance, beating on drums, certain kinds of social rituals. To break through the humdrumness, the over-learned, ordinary, to open up that sense of wonder, it's that sense of wonder that some theorists are actually speculating that that sense of wonder turns on the so-called immediate early genes. Within in two or three minutes of being surprised and interested in something, certain genes will turn on the neurons in your brain, and they set the stage for the physical growth of the brain.</p>

<p>Kjos: One of the concerns we often have about a theory is how does it work with different cultures, and you just mentioned...</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes.</p>

<p>Kjos: ...this really imports, in a sense, or includes...</p>

<p>Rossi: Well, I've had a lot of experience with that because I've been invited to different places around the world. Just last year, for example, I was in Brazil and they wanted to compare my approaches with those of certain native healers. And it split right down the middle. Half of the audience felt that...</p>

<p>Well, everyone acknowledged that we did a lot of things in common. That we evoke the sense of wonder, the sense of expectation, the sense of tuning in. That was the common denominator. But then there was another group, very vehement, "But no, Rossi is very different because Rossi really doesn't believe that spirits exist." Whereas for their native healers, they really were spirits. On the other hand, one of my mentors, Dr. David Cheek, really believes. He's a western physician, psychiatrist. He was raised in Singapore. He really did believe that the spirits worked, that spirits existed. And he would work with me. You know, he was a specialist in finger signaling. I don't believe in spirits. But when David Cheek grabbed your hand, flopped it down and said, "Now which is the 'yes' finger? Which is the 'no' finger?" you'd start going dizzy, and automatic behavior would start coming in.</p>

<p>Carlson: So how does this approach, though, accommodate the different cultures?</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. This is what I find in common with many cultures. Each culture seems to have its own genius, its own way of imposing a certain belief system that binds the culture together, and that works for most people. And the other people, the originality of their life experience, the growth of the brain, wants to go off in another direction, so they become the so-called mentally ill. So every culture has rituals to give them space, to help them go through their unique experience and come back. So this is...each culture has its constraints but it also has its breakthrough rituals. Later this year, for example, I've been invited to present to the first world psychotherapy congress in Africa, and I've been invited because I'm a mind-body therapist, and they want to compare my approaches with several different African traditions. I expect my experience is going to be similar. We're going to see a genius in each of these African cultures, and we're also going to see the constraints.</p>

<p>And creativity is that fine line between constraint on the one hand and chaos on the other.</p>

<p>Carlson: This approach is so broad. How was it developed, and who were some of your teachers? I mean, it sounds like it could have been anyone, from...</p>

<p>Rossi: Right.</p>

<p>Carlson: drummers to physicists.</p>

<p>Rossi: There are many roots. One of the deepest roots would be native healing. Another, in the western culture, would be hypnosis. A number of my mentors, like Milton H. Erickson, comes from the hypnosis. David Cheek. Another mentor, Dr. Franz Alexander, comes from western medicine and psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>Carlson: He was a body therapist.</p>

<p>Rossi: The body therapists, above all. Fritz Perls, Alexander Lowen. I've had personal experiences with all of them. What the body therapists...They have a genius for tuning into the body, but they don't seem to have the theory of how it actually works on a theoretical mind-gene connection. That's why I'm trying to bring them all together.</p>

<p>Kjos: What about, uh...Kind of shifting a bit here, but what about working with groups, or couples, or families? Have you done that kind of work?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. This is my favorite way of working. I love to work with a large group. Usually it's professionals, because that's the kind of people who invite me, and I will introduce them to some of my rituals, some of my hand techniques that you're going to see on the video in a little while, and even though I give the same instructions to the whole group, everyone has a different experience. Everyone tends to have that problem of the constraint between their own original experience and what they feel social expectations are constraining them to. </p>

<p>So after going through the experience for about 10 or 15 minutes, I'll go through the audience. "Who wants to volunteer? What happened to you?" And it's usually the same thing. We'll find always the constraints and their originality, and how do they navigate between those two. The astounding thing is that many people will have classical hypnotic phenomena occurring-amnesias, hallucinations-even though I don't suggest them. So here, even though I've been brought up in the hypnotic tradition, I don't believe in traditional hypnosis, that the essence of hypnosis is suggestion. That's anathema to me. I believe the essence of hypnosis is tuning into the new, that borderline between the conscious and unconscious, that growing edge of the personality. And as you found to my, your despair probably, Jon, one of my recent books, The Symptom Path, I've been developing, integrating, the new, nonlinear dynamics of chaos theory. </p>

<p>Because chaos theory talks about that...at the edge between the known and the unknown, between  the well-established and un-established, that's where the creative edge is, and that's where maximal computation takes place, even on a mathematical level.</p>

<p>Carlson: Can you talk a little bit about couples and families though, with this? You use it in groups, and it works very well there. It works with individuals. Would you ever see a family?</p>

<p>Rossi: Oh, absolutely. And in many ways, I can be a conventional family therapist, but then there'll always come the place in any family where things get tight, things get rigid, and now we have...we need to confront each other. Rather than that other confrontation--I mean, I'll explore that in a conventional way. And then when even that fails, then I'll pull out some of my mind-body approaches and I'll say to them, "Okay, why don't you all put your hands out like so, and just tune in with a certain amount of sensitivity," and they will each have their own experience. And then there is a sense of wonder after 15 or 20 minutes. "What did you experience, Mom?"</p>

<p>"Well I experienced such-and-such." So, whereas before they were hitting at each other, now they get insight into their own unique individualities.</p>

<p>Carlson: That creates a connection?</p>

<p>Rossi: Right, it creates an open space to wonder. We break out of conventional little territory, "You're going to clean your room," or "You're not going to clean..." These little power struggles are all transcended when people learn to tune into their own experience and share that in a group. That's what... a tenderness comes forth, all possibilities.</p>

<p>Kjos: Are there clients that this just doesn't work with?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, the typical Marlboro man. You know, beautiful, handsome man. So I say, "Why don't you place your hands about like so and tune into them with a certain amount of sensitivity and let me know what happens next." And they'll go..."That's right. Tune in." After a couple of moments, they'll look up at me.</p>

<p>Obviously, they're not going inside. They think that I'm going to do some hocus-pocus or magic on them. So it's those people that come, especially if they know I'm a hypnotherapist, they come with the expectation that hypnosis is some kind of magic and I'm going to put them in a trance and I'm going to tell them what to experience. Well, if you insist, I'll do that. But that's a ritual that works very well with some people, but I feel my more nondirective approaches evoke that sense of wonder a lot more quickly.</p>

<p>Carlson: So the kind of person this approach works best for is the highly motivated? The...</p>

<p>Rossi: I think it works absolutely best with that difficult group of people who have a lot of psychosomatic symptoms. The people that used to be called hysterical. That is, they have a lot of mind-body information flowing but they don't know what to do with it, so it comes out in the form of symptoms.</p>

<p>So with these people, I immediately develop-well, it's almost a mantra-how I can help them convert their symptoms into signals that their body, mind-body is trying to...And what, you tune into that pain, and stay with it just for a moment a two, and let's see what you begin to experience next.</p>

<p>Carlson: So that's how these symptoms, then, do become pathways or signals for change.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's right. So after awhile, after all what is a symptom, and in this mind-body point-of-view, a symptom is a mind-body signal that you have not been paying attention to, so the mind-body has to get louder, and louder. Finally it puts up a megaphone and it throws in so much stimulation, we call it pain, or a headache, or a stomachache. But as you tune in with great receptivity, then the messenger doesn't have to shout so loud. So after awhile you just get a little twinge. Oh. Maybe I have to start changing my behavior here, because I'm doing the same old thing again.</p>

<p>Carlson: So the greater the symptoms, the greater the readiness for change?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, profoundly, yes.</p>

<p>Carlson: I see.</p>

<p>Rossi: Now there could be people on the other side. For example, I'm often asked, well what about the borderline personality? What about the people with a psychotic process? Frankly, I haven't worked with this population very much, but...some of my colleagues have, and if a person isn't in an institution because they're out of control, this becomes a very interesting way for them to learn how to...what the voices are really trying to tell them, what their mysterious symptoms are trying to tell them. Another interesting group is with children. </p>

<p>Carlson: Really?</p>

<p>Rossi: Mary Pratt at the University of Florida just used some of my approach with a group of children for a dissertation from four to nine, and it was duck soup. It was just beautiful. The only thing from my point of view, she did it wrong.</p>

<p>Carlson: So it even works when you do it wrong.</p>

<p>Rossi: I always ask questions: "Can you tune in with sensitivity? Do you experience anything different?" She, through a certain kind of oversight that is very common, turned my questions into statements, so that your hands will such-and-such. </p>

<p>Carlson: Just a slight inflection at the end was...</p>

<p>Rossi: That's right, that slight...And yet it still works. The kids had a lot of fun. So it's..it is...Most of my approaches are what I would call failsafe. The worst that can happen is they fail. And in what sense do they fail? Nothing happens. The Marlboro man: hmm?</p>

<p>Kjos: How did you arrive at being a mind-body therapist? How did you...</p>

<p>Rossi: Hmm...You want the childhood stories or the professional stories?</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, how about some of each?</p>

<p>Rossi: Well, I can tell you about Grandpa, Ernest Rossi, the fellow I was named after. He was an immigrant from the old country. He was...He dug, actually by hand, the subways of New York. That's how long ago this...  He got a stroke when he was in his early 40s. He was laid up; he was a cripple. So all the family had to go to work: his wife, my father. My father couldn't even go to high school. So, since everybody had to work, Grandpa was my babysitter, and he was a terror. He had this "matz" this cane that my father made for him out of a broomstick. That's how poor we were. Well, anyway, every other week, it seems, someone came along with a new bit of snake oil, a new drug for grandpa to try. And Grandpa would try the drug, his eyes would light up, he'd get on the matz, he'd struggle up, we'd all stand around him, and then he'd throw down the matz, he would take a step, and then fall back again. Well, he's getting better. But he never seemed to get really well. </p>

<p>Also, as a child I had polio, just a little touch of it like city kids get, only they didn't call it polio. They called it Charley-horse. Well, what was Charley-horse? You began limping a little bit. Well, you shouldn't limp. Usually it was around the fall or winter when you went back to school that you got this little Charley-horse. So I'd start limping a little bit and my father would, whack, hit me in the back of the head. "You never limped before. You're not going to start limping now." That was the negative whip. On the other hand, I was also indentured to this shoe repairman. I was going to become a shoe repairman, you know? I was only nine or ten years old, and Patsy, my shoe repair boss, said, "You know, Ernie,"-he was also from Italy-"in the old country, kids had this all the time. You should not be ashamed. I'm going to tell you the truth, how you can really take care of this. Don't tell your father I told you this. At night when your parents go to sleep, you sneak down to the cellar and you get some wine." My father made his own wine.</p>

<p> "You just need half a glass, you know, three-quarters, not more than that. You sneak it upstairs. You put it by your windowsill so it gets cold at night (because this was, like, in Connecticut and it was cold falls). The next morning, you get up before anybody gets up. You drink the wine." And he would imply that it wasn't really the blood and body of Christ. That was for after your holy communion. That was the real..."But God will make it a little bit of his blood, and that will heal you. And then, you know, you gotta walk a little bit, exercise your foot before your father gets up. Then he won't hit you." And I did. And I would walk up and down the hall, avoiding certain boards so they wouldn't squeak. And after awhile my father would look out. "Ernie, what are you doing up?" "Well, I'm just getting up, Dad." But by the time I got up, my joints were oiled, and it worked. </p>

<p>Carlson: Right.</p>

<p>Rossi: And then I met Milton H. Erickson, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Carlson: Um-hmm. So that's the professional side, but it came with a long, long history, of training from a variety of people.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, yeah. All these humble folks that I come from. They had their own little rituals, their own little stories. And as you see, they worked. </p>

<p>Kjos: Healing...</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, healing stories. It's a culture that we don't know about. We talk about many different cultures. Right here, within America, we have...we're a melting pot of so many cultures. And I don't think I ever did tell my parents what Patsy told me to do. I never told a priest that this guy gave me a little bit of the blood of Christ, my wine in the morning. That's what healed me.</p>

<p>Carlson: So this approach is very broad. It has...It works in all aspects of life. Is there research that supports it? </p>

<p>Rossi: Ah, that's the problem. You see...</p>

<p>Carlson: It could be the solution, then.</p>

<p>Rossi: There are infinite amounts of research, but you're not going to go to the library and look up, put mind-body therapy into a computer and get a lot of research, because it's known under the rubric of hypnosis. It's known under the rubric of psychophysiology. Now the rubric of psychoneuroimmunology, that's the new, popular field. And this is where the new research base is coming in, I would say.</p>

<p>Carlson: Okay, so at this time there really isn't any clear research base, but there are a lot of areas that we could draw research from to talk about its effectiveness?</p>

<p>Rossi: That's exactly what my books are about. It's mostly pulling together research from many areas and saying, "Do you see how this all fits together? How this all reinforces itself? How we can really trace this pattern of mind-body communication?"</p>

<p>Carlson: Well, in a few minutes, we're going to watch you work with a young woman. Can you let us know what your goals were for this work? Kind of to set up?</p>

<p>Rossi: Well initially I had no goals because I had never met this person. I didn't get any information on the person.</p>

<p>Carlson: Sure.</p>

<p>Rossi: But she gave me some goals right in the very first few minutes. I haven't seen the tape. It happened so soon, I don't even know if it shows on the tape, but very quickly, she indicated to me that she had been through this therapy thing a number of times. I guess I'm the ninth or tenth person she worked with. And she intimated that it was all the same, uh, oh, there was one art therapist. That was different, that was fun. But she implied that people gave her a lot of advice or counseling, and it seems like it was stuff imposed from the outside. So that already told me that an outer counseling reality-oriented approach was not going to work with her. So it immediately gave me my first cue: Ah, I wonder if I need to do inner work? Imagery, so-called hypnosis, dream work. So that gave me a little set. Then, I would say the...I began exploring gingerly, you know, what is going to be the access to her inner world? Since the outer structures weren't working so well. </p>

<p>And you'll see I gingerly try this approach, I try that approach. Finally, almost in desperation, I said, "Well, would you say that you're a spiritual person?" Uh, at that point, you know, I've tried a number of things and I'm almost in desperation. Because when you use the word "spiritual," it implies for a lot of people a sense of wonder, an opening, so that's...However, even here, it turned out that she, yes, she prayed, and I saw very quickly she had a very conventional idea of spirit. It wasn't until after the interview that you told me her father was actually a minister. So she got a very strong dose of how it's supposed to be, rather than her own original experience. But I think it was just a little bit before, or a little bit, probably a little bit after that, she talked about, she had these skills in mathematics, and I expressed a sense of wonder, that was something new about her. And then she gave me my opening. She says, "But you know, I don't have any imagination. " </p>

<p>I thought, "Oh, great, that's exactly what I need."</p>

<p>Carlson: So what would you call...would you call these accessing cues? Is that what you're looking for?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes</p>

<p>Carlson: Is that like the first step of an intervention, the accessing? </p>

<p>Rossi: That's right. I call it the basic accessing questions. </p>

<p>Carlson: Because what happens...what is the second part that we should look for, then?</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. Well, when she comes out with this, "I don't have the imagination," that was my cue to immediately jump in and say, "Okay, would you be interested in exploring some new approaches where we can explore the possibilities?" And of course, who's going to say no?</p>

<p>Carlson: Not a minister's daughter, for sure.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's right. They do try to comply. And you utilize that: their compliant, outer orientation. But you try to utilize it in a way that's unique and different. For example, as someone to look at their hands almost as if they've never seen them before. Of course, that's an indirect suggestion for dissociation, but they don't know that.</p>

<p>It immediately starts evoking a different kind of a mental set. And do they feel the same, or different? And people don't usually tune into that. So I ask a series of basic accessing questions that the conscious mind does not know how to answer. The only way an answer can come is by tuning into the body, tuning into the body's sensations, feelings, in a new kind of a way, a kind of an original way. So I have many novel approaches. This novelty is what evokes that sense of wonder. Remember, that sense of wonder turns on the immediate early genes within a couple of minutes, and that starts the process of...</p>

<p>Carlson: Of new learning.</p>

<p>Rossi: New learning. That's the essence.</p>

<p>Session Transcript </p>

<p>Dr. Rossi: Okay, Robin. I guess we're on. Do you want to say anything about what you hope we can accomplish here today?</p>

<p>Robin: I guess maybe just get to know you a little bit and something that you might have that you could share with me that, you know, might help in some of my...</p>

<p>Rossi: Oh, about my background?</p>

<p>Robin: Yes.</p>

<p>Rossi: Well, it's very mixed and rich. I was originally trained as a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst. First I was a Freudian analyst then I became a Jungian analyst. I studied how to become a hypnotherapist with a very famous hypnotherapist, and I've written a lot of books in the past 20, 25 years in the area of dreams, psychotherapy, hypnosis. Also mind-body work. I'm very much interested in how mind and body communicate, and stuff like that.</p>

<p>Robin: That's really, that's some good stuff, though. Do you, do you think there's a lot of importance in dreams?</p>

<p>Rossi: Oh, yes. My very first book was about dreams. Do you recall your dreams easily?</p>

<p>Robin: Sometimes I can. You know, sometimes I have dreams that I don't like and I don't know if they're like, like telling me that something's going to happen or.... You know, I've had some, some strange dreams that, like if I look back on them, like I might be at a weird place, like I might be at the Sears Tower, and I might have visited the Sears Tower maybe a month prior, but it got put in and I'm with somebody else that I don't have a clue who I'm with. And just, just strange, strange situations.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, dreams are like that. They bring parts of our life and usually there's something new, and that's what makes them interesting because often it's the growing edge of our personality. Do you want to say more about that dream? Or is there another dream you'd like to share?</p>

<p>Robin: Well, how.... Why is it that we remember some dreams and don't remember other dreams? Like I can say, "Boy, I had a really good dream last night. I just can't remember what it was." You know. Is that to do with like the levels of...</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. It has to do with your level of sleep. But you know, it's really a mystery. There's a lot of theories, a lot of different opinions. I'm of the theory that in dreams it's like an experimental theater. We're rehearsing or we're looking, exploring possibilities for our life. And it's just precisely those things that seem strange or bizarre or unusual, that's the interesting thing. So if you have any strange, unusual dreams, those would be the ones that...</p>

<p>Robin: I'm trying to think. My husband has more strange ones than I do, to be quite honest. But I have had dreams in the past where, like I'm, I'm by myself. And it's like I don't know anybody around me. Trying to think. And I sometimes feel isolated. I'm like calling out to somebody and can't find them and they're nowhere to be found. I don't like those kind of dreams.</p>

<p>Rossi: Right. Obviously, it's like some part of you feels isolated and you're trying to make connections, but you're not.</p>

<p>Robin: No. No. It's hard.</p>

<p>Rossi: Can you see this as the story of your life in any way? In any sense?</p>

<p>Robin: If I had to relate that, I don't like to be.... I'm not a loner. I don't like to be a loner. I like to be, I've been tested, diagnosed, whatever, as like a people-pleaser person. And I would say maybe that might be, that might be why those dreams are scary to me. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, it's like dreams are usually trying to solve a problem, but sometimes we get stuck in the middle, like this dream is presenting the problem to you, Robin, in some way, you want to make contact but you're alone among strangers. Now what would be a nice way for that dream to continue? Suppose you...</p>

<p>Robin: Well, if I could make it continue, I'd, you know, run into somebody that would say, you know, "Here I am. Here I am." I'd be calling out to somebody and they would find me, and it'd be like, okay, then we can continue on the path together, whatever, wherever that might take us, you know.</p>

<p>Rossi: Why don't you go with that right now, and see where you take that path together, you and your newfound friend.</p>

<p>Robin: I guess it'd just be searching the unknown. If, if I could take somebody with me, I'd, you know, I wouldn't be afraid. I wouldn't.... I'd have somebody there for support.</p>

<p>Rossi: To help you face the unknown.</p>

<p>Robin: Whatever might come, you know.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, that's right. So really, that's what you're looking for: ideal friends, partners, to give you the support for the unknown. And what is....</p>

<p>Robin: The unknown?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, what would the unknown in your life be?</p>

<p>Robin: Oh, it could be just waking up tomorrow morning, because I have a 2 1/2 year old and it's like I can wake up and something new happens. Like I'm a very organized person, and anything and everything could happen. My whole day could be totally changed. </p>

<p>Rossi: A 2 year old. That's your life with a 2 year old. I've raised a couple kids myself, so I really know.</p>

<p>Robin: So it's like, you know, it could change. And I could get phone calls because I'm real involved in things and I, I might say, "Today, I'm staying home. I'm not going to do anything." And then I get a phone call and it's like, "Okay. I'll go." And then I'll, you know, run errands all day and things like that, but.... So it changes from day to day, so it's like, can't, the unknown.... I never say "never" anymore. </p>

<p>Rossi: Right. The unexpected.</p>

<p>Robin: Because I usually eat those words. "I'm not going to do this. No, I'm not." And then I end up doing it, so.</p>

<p>Rossi: In other words, there's a part of you that wants a little shelter, a little time for yourself but you're involved with people and there's a lot of demands on you. You've got your own child to take care of and people are continually pulling on you for stuff. And that could be using up a lot of your energy, that maybe you really want to keep inside for your own development, what you really need.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah, I.... I probably.... I guess when I get down and feel like I'm completely empty, it's because I'm drained and I haven't taken some time for myself.</p>

<p>Rossi: Exactly. Exactly.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Rossi: Very, very important we take that time for ourselves. As a matter of fact, that's just what one of my books is about.</p>

<p>Robin: Oh, really?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, the idea is that every hour and a half, we go through a natural mind-body cycle. For the first part of the hour and a half, the mind has energy, the body has energy. It wants to go out there; it wants to do something. And then you do something, and then other hormones flow and you need a quiet time, a 20-minute break, so to speak. So it's like if this happens continuously, you know, throughout the day, every couple hours you have a chance to do a nice unit of work, you know, be with your child, do the shopping or do the cooking, but then you really need to take that time to take a break, because that's when the body heals itself.</p>

<p>So this could be.... I'm just giving you ammunition so you can say "no" when you really need to.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. Well, I wouldn't think that, I mean.... I can understand it, because when my son takes his nap, that is like my time.</p>

<p>Rossi: Right.</p>

<p>Robin: I have to take that time for myself, because if I don't.... I mean, if I do do work, fine. I'm doing work. It's something that I want to do, but I make the decision if I'm going to or if I'm not because....</p>

<p>Rossi: Fantastic. That's the best. Yes.</p>

<p>Robin: It gets hard. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yes. You have to be tough, because the outside world will just use you up, and you've been, you've been so put upon by a lot of people, that you tend to get used up that way. And the ideal circumstance, like now you're learning how to say "no" appropriately, to take time for yourself.</p>

<p>That's going to give you extra reserve time for, you know, things to be created within yourself. Do you have any idea, Robin, like where you're headed, five, 10 years? What would your whole system like to do? What would you like to be in five, 10 years? In other words, what are you shooting for when you...</p>

<p>Robin: I, you know, I can't see five, 10 years down the road. I mean, I come up with ideas, you know, things that I'd like to do, like I like to work with crafts. I mean, I could go back to work. I had, I was real successful in the banking industry.</p>

<p>Rossi: Banking industry? Really?</p>

<p>Robin: I enjoyed that a lot, did that for 10 years. And it's like, okay. There are options available to me, but after I had my son, all of the sudden, my mind changed there and said, "Okay, this is my first priority. This is what I want to do."</p>

<p>Rossi: Right. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Robin: "And everything else then will revolve around that." So, you know, who knows? Like if he does well in school, I might be able to go back to work. If he doesn't, I might be real involved taking care of him and making sure, you know, he gets the proper education and stuff, so. </p>

<p>Rossi: Are you married?</p>

<p>Robin: Yes.</p>

<p>Rossi: Married. Okay.</p>

<p>Robin: My husband, he's not real good at giving that good support. Actually, he's in the doghouse right now.</p>

<p>Rossi: Ah, that's the problem.</p>

<p>Robin: Well, I mean, he's supportive in the fact of me staying at home, but far as, he happens to be one of those people that likes to take from me, too, and not give anything back sometimes.</p>

<p>Rossi: Oh, I see. Yeah. Wow. Wish he were here now.</p>

<p>Robin: And he's glad he's not.</p>

<p>Rossi: He knows what's up here, maybe.</p>

<p>Robin: Oh, yeah. No, but it makes, it makes it difficult, but it's sort of like if I can take myself out of the day-to-day and think about what the actual long-term goal is, you know, then it makes it a little bit easier. But sometimes, in that day-to-day, I can get really overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, with a 2-year-old child, you've really got your hands full. But even if it's only that when he goes down to take a nap there is some time for you, and I think you're wise. You do have to just wonder what's, how's life going to unfold.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. Yeah, looking ahead. Yeah, because we, I mean, we try to make plans, you know, as a family, where do we want to be, you know, far as, say, socially, economically. You know, what are our goals? What do we want to do?</p>

<p>Rossi: Talk about these things with your husband, okay. How's that going?</p>

<p>Robin: He-Well, it's one of those things, he, he doesn't, you know, far as he's concerned, all he wants to be is debt-free, and as soon as he's debt-free then everything else is fine, you know. So I know he's worried about financial and where.... As long as I'm taking care of Cameron, he's not, that's not a problem. But far as some of the other things like getting stuff done around the house, he's like, "Oh, it'll get done when we get to it." You know, he's not.... He's a procrastinator with things like that, but where I want things done and want them done on a specific, a specific timetable, he doesn't.</p>

<p>Rossi: So he's worried about debt. Do you have unusual debts or is this just, you know, paying off your mortgage?</p>

<p>Robin: No, he.... Well, it's, all we really have is our mortgage, but he, his parents, when they were younger, did have financial problems and then got themselves completely out of debt themselves and now, you know....</p>

<p>Rossi: He's got that same philosophy.</p>

<p>Robin: He's got that same philosophy that, you know, he's got to get himself, you know.... I mean, and some, some economists say, you know, this is a goal that you should attain.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. There's some virtue in it. But still, there's life to be lived now. </p>

<p>Robin: This is just a fact of life, yeah. You know, like you want to enjoy life now. You can't wait until you're, you know, so... But we struggle with that, but that, I think everybody does. You have one that's a saver and one that's a spender, and you need to compromise.</p>

<p>Rossi: I see. He's the saver, and you're the spender. Is that...</p>

<p>Robin: Well, yes and no.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's really not a fair way to divide it up.</p>

<p>Robin: No. Not, well, it depends on, you know, what type of, what type it is, you know. Like I'm very conservative and make sure that I get my money's worth, but I don't hesitate spending a dollar if I'm going to get a dollar's worth.</p>

<p>Rossi: Right. If it's needed for your real life at this time.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Rossi: But he's a little bit conservative that way, I suppose. </p>

<p>Robin: Unless it's like for a bass boat or something. Then he'd be like, "Oh, but we need this. It's important." Those, those male toys that he needs sometimes. </p>

<p>Rossi: Right. That's just what I was curious about. Are you able to find areas where you want to spend your money.... Do you see eye to eye in the way you have fun together, the way you....</p>

<p>Robin: We have differences there, far as, like, his idea of fun and my idea of fun are totally.... Like I like the arts. I would like to go to a theater, to a play, where he'd prefer to go to a ballgame and.... You know, things like that.</p>

<p>Rossi: Classic stereotype there.</p>

<p>Robin: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. </p>

<p>Rossi: Oh, wow. </p>

<p>Robin: I'd call him, you know, like an old jock or something, you know. He really likes all that but doesn't get into any of the things I do. So there has to be an appreciation on both, so. </p>

<p>Rossi: That is, that's the secret... </p>

<p>Robin: He's learning. But....</p>

<p>Rossi: You can open up new areas for him. And you say he's learning, he's.... What areas have you got his interest in, if you will?</p>

<p>Robin: What have we done? Well, we've gone to, we have... Well, no, I've done that by myself. I was going to say, "We did this," but no, I did that myself. Concerts. He doesn't necessarily always like the kind of music I like to listen to, but he will go with me to a concert or something like that. And we're at a different stage in our marriage. We're really, I want to say, almost struggling right now because I think we need to have some couple time together where he thinks that, you know, we wanted children so therefore we should spend all our time with our son and not take that time for each other. So I'm trying to work on that right now. </p>

<p>Rossi: Right. Some good quality time together as a couple quite apart from your child being with you.</p>

<p>Robin: I see other mothers doing it and how much fun it's been for them and it makes them enjoy their children more.</p>

<p>Rossi: Of course.</p>

<p>Robin: And then you appreciate your husband, too.</p>

<p>Rossi: I sense you're a deeply romantic kind of a person.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Rossi: Very, very important.</p>

<p>Robin: Not at important at all for him.</p>

<p>Rossi: Uh-oh. It's too much take-me-out-to-the-ballgame with this guy.</p>

<p>Robin: Well, actually, now I have, I could make that a really fun time. I mean, we have gone....</p>

<p>Rossi: Going to the ballgame, that can be okay. It's trying to find some of your quality time when it comes into your ballpark. I think this is the very important crux, because if you're life's going to continue happily together, it's going to be very important that he learn to share with you and grow, just as you've shared his life. </p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. I've had different people give me different advice about either A) going and buying the tickets to a show and say, "Okay, I've arranged the babysitter. We're going. End of discussion." You know, "Here's the tickets." But I just don't, you know....</p>

<p>And then I thought, you know, what if it backfires on me and then I'm sitting here, and then I'm thinking, well, I can take somebody else that would enjoy it and I'd still, you know, enjoy the theater myself, you know. But....</p>

<p>Rossi: It's something-</p>

<p>Robin: The thing, the thing, I guess the thing that I have the hardest time is, I can't make him do something I want him to do. The only person I can change is me. But...</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. That's true. So you've received a certain amount of advice on how to handle it in an external kind of a way, buying tickets and so forth. I would like to take-since you've already gone that route and it's left something to be desired-I'd like to explore another route where we're, you know, you're interested in arts. You're interested in creativity. </p>

<p>I'd like to help that side of you develop today. That'd be okay?</p>

<p>Robin: Okay. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Rossi: I call it doing inner work, you know. In other words, you get a focus inside. I would like to have you, right at this moment, just tune into this whole issue with your husband, how you'd really like it to be. And you know, a lot of this is private, by the way. You only share with me what's appropriate to be shared publicly. But a lot of this work takes place privately within you, and I would like to see you really get a, go on an inner journey, so to speak. What's your husband's name?</p>

<p>Robin: Ed.</p>

<p>Rossi: Ed. Okay. What would be an ideal situation for you and Ed to be together? And I don't want you to talk to me about it. I want you just to, you know, tune into yourself and, for a couple minutes, and see where your mind takes you. </p>

<p>Let's see if a new fantasy is created, a new idea, a new possibility. Or is it maybe something you've had in mind for some time? </p>

<p>Robin: You mean take, go to a place that I would want to go?</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Yeah. Go to that ideal situation with Ed, just you and Ed, romantically together. And just allow that to develop within you. That's right. Really going with that.</p>

<p>Robin: You talk about the impossible. It could happen, but it'd take a lot of work. It'd take a lot of work.</p>

<p>Rossi: But you found a nice....</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: Is it something new or is it something that you've daydreamed about before?</p>

<p>Robin: Probably, yeah, I've daydreamed about it before.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. But I heard you use the word "impossible." It seems like it would be impossible?</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. So. Obviously it's going to take a little preparation, somehow, for that to happen. Would you be willing to go back inside again and what would be the circumstances that could possibly lead to this nice outcome?</p>

<p>Robin: It'd have to be a lot of me, me doing a lot of the work and me being patient when Ed said, "Well, I don't really want to do that," and basically stroking him to agree to do something like that. And I have a problem with that because sometimes when he puts up a front, instead of trying to looking at it in a positive, and keep, you know, stroking him, it's like....</p>

<p>Rossi: You've had too much of this. You've been doing too much stroking of other people. This is...</p>

<p>Robin: Uh-huh. And it's like, I can let loose with him and, and then it gets nowhere.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. It gets to be just hard work. Okay, so it seems like on the outside there's something that's stuck in your relationship. Now, you've tried and I'm sure he's trying in his way. So we have to go to another level. Are you a spiritual person in any...</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Very much.</p>

<p>Rossi: Very much so. Okay. That's where I'd like to have you take another inner journey and commune with your spirit in whatever way that happens and let's see....</p>

<p>Robin: Well, see then.... You hit the nail right on the head because that's one thing that, that I, I go back to the scriptures where it says, "Nothing is impossible with God." And so I shouldn't be sitting here saying, "Oh, it's impossible. Ed will never change." That's not true. I know that that's not true. If I have enough faith, if I believe enough, it will happen. But it's sort of like I, the phrase we've coined is, "It will happen in God's time." Well, it's sort of like, you know, God's moving awful slow right now. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yes. Too slow.</p>

<p>Robin: Just not, you know.... But it does, it does make it difficult at times, but I know that it, that it's, that it's not impossible but it takes a lot of prayer, dedication on my part and steadfastness.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Yeah, I'm, I'm... want to explore something a little bit different. I would like to have you commune with your spirit in a way that's.... You've tried prayer. You've tried, you know, strong faith. Somehow another way of relating to your inner spirit, go into your inner spirit just with what you've just told me right now, saying, "Look, in God's time or is it going to be possible now? Come on, Spirit, you're supposed to be so great. What can you tell me?" Why don't you take a little journey with that? Let's see if anything new develops.</p>

<p>Robin: Still go back.... Not that it's new, but that I have, that I have to be patient, that I have to be understanding. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Yeah. Those are very good conventional virtues, but something more intriguing, something more interesting. Let me ask you this: were you one of those kinds of kids that was fascinated with fairy tales when you were a kid? What fascinated you when you were a kid? What was intriguing?</p>

<p>Robin: Well, I loved math, mathematics.</p>

<p>Rossi: Really? Mathematics! Wow.</p>

<p>Robin: Analytical thinking, the processes.</p>

<p>Rossi: I see. That's probably how you got into banking. Fantastic. So that's....</p>

<p>Robin: So.... I analyze things.</p>

<p>Rossi: You like to analyze things.</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: Are you using that talent in any way in your current life?</p>

<p>Robin: Oh, I do. Mm-hmm. A lot. You know, like this is the situation I'm in. What are my options? What are ways, you know, that I can do things to make it better, you know, or get things accomplished, you know? </p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah.</p>

<p>Robin: I do use it a lot.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah.</p>

<p>Robin: But sometimes I do think in, in my spiritual life and things like that, that can hinder you sometimes because you're not letting God work. In other words, you're trying to analyze God and you can't do that.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. That's like two different universes. They don't always mix.</p>

<p>Robin: Sure. Sure. But I do analyze a lot.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah.</p>

<p>Robin: I can analyze this to death. And I guess that's the thing that bothers me the most, is I can talk about it till I'm blue in the face but I'm not getting anything accomplished if I keep talking about it.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, that's....</p>

<p>Robin: It takes action.</p>

<p>Rossi: Right. Action and imagination, you know. It's like....</p>

<p>Robin: I.... Imagination is very low on my ability or skills.</p>

<p>Rossi: Ah, okay. Then maybe that's how I can best help you today, help you find the access to your imagination, the intuitive. Because you've obviously got a very bright, analytical mind. You've obviously got a wonderful spiritual connection. You've got all the human virtues of patience and all this. But we've finally found the developmental point: you need to evolve with your imagination. Would you like to explore some...</p>

<p>Robin: Sure.</p>

<p>Rossi: ... new conventional approaches that....</p>

<p>Robin: Sure.</p>

<p>Rossi: Place your hands about like so. </p>

<p>Robin: Okay.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's right. And now, Robin, look at your hands almost as if you've never seen them before and tune into your hands with a certain amount of sensitivity. And in a moment or two, just share with me a sentence or two of what you're actually experiencing in your hands. The same or different or what.</p>

<p>Robin: I'm bad. See, I.... There's a warmth that it's picking up from the lights.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah?</p>

<p>Robin: They can feel the warmth.</p>

<p>Rossi: Good. Go with that warmth. Let's say like the, if the warmth is a messenger coming from your body, I wonder where the warmth is going to lead you next. Remember, this is an exercise in sensitivity and just letting your imagination go. </p>

<p>Robin: It causes, it causes the hand to almost tingle.</p>

<p>Rossi: Tingle. Yes, that's good. That's even more intriguing. Go with that tingling now.</p>

<p>Robin: It's like, you know, how, the... the blood flows through and, and goes back out and it's like you can, you can feel that. You can sense. And it's intriguing sometimes to know that, you know, you have four fingers and a thumb. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Go with those intriguing things. </p>

<p>Robin: That they're important. They all serve a function. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yes.</p>

<p>Robin: You take it for granted sometimes.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, maybe we take it too much for granted.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah, because I sometimes see people with, with a missing finger and, you know. They've had to learn things differently to be able to function, so. There's....</p>

<p>Rossi: Stay with your hands for a little while yet. And again, we're.... I'm asking you to tune in with great sensitivity. You felt warmth. You felt tingling. I wonder if any other experiences, sensations or feelings....</p>

<p>Robin: Well, being like this, they can almost, by looking at them, they can become stiff.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Go with that. Explore that stiffness. Yes. </p>

<p>Robin: Because you have to be able, you know, just holding them like this, there's a stiffness and it's like they want to have a tendency to want to curl in.</p>

<p>Rossi: Good. Let them curl in. That's it. Now go with that.</p>

<p>Robin: Then you can like make your fist.</p>

<p>Rossi: Now, you've got a fist now. Go with that fist.</p>

<p>Robin: It uses energy. It stretches them.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, express that energy, Robin, with nice fists. Really enjoy that for a moment and let's see where it leads you to next.</p>

<p>Robin: It gives you that, it gives you a release, you know, when you hold it.</p>

<p>Rossi: Sure it does.</p>

<p>Robin: You hold it nice and tight.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Yeah. Hold it nice and tight. And let that tightness take you someplace now, holding it nice and tight. </p>

<p>Robin: It's like you can't let go. </p>

<p>Rossi: Good. Stay with that. You can't let go. And really going with that: something you can't let go of.</p>

<p>Robin: I can't let go of control. I...</p>

<p>Rossi: You can't let go of control. Okay, go with that now: you can't let go of control.</p>

<p>Robin: I like to be in control.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Yeah. Continue with that. This is like a metaphor, story of your life. You like to be in control, and go with it now. I don't know if your mind wants to take you to where you learned that or what you need to control or just what?</p>

<p>Robin: Well, it's a sign of frustration. It's a sign of, you know, the tightness is a sign of anger. It creates pain.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes. Really receive that: anger, pain, frustration. Let yourself experience all those things for a moment and then where they take you next.</p>

<p>Robin: They want release.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, they want release.</p>

<p>Robin: I mean, I dug the nails into the side of my hand.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, I noticed they're actually red.</p>

<p>Robin: So. Sometimes I have a tendency to do that with my teeth. I clench my teeth.</p>

<p>Rossi: I see. Grit your teeth. But, so it feels good to stop, so to speak. They want release.</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay, tune into yourself now, Robin, and let yourself experience to what extent... are you still feeling release? And if so, going with that release.</p>

<p>Robin: Well, it's like it wants release, and my hands can make it do it but I don't know that I can make it do that.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's right. You don't know how yet, but something in your hands is guiding you, that tension, the fists.</p>

<p>Robin: So you can clench them, you can let it go.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah.</p>

<p>Robin: But... It's letting go of control. I don't like to do that.</p>

<p>Rossi: Oh. That's why we're creating a safe little therapy situation. It's like a little experimental theater where you can explore control and letting go and that's, that's kind of an exercise we're starting to create. So yeah, so continue that for a.... Get that tight control, and then when you get it really tight, hold as tight as you can for a moment or two, and then let yourself fully experience what's it like to release, actually?</p>

<p>Robin: Oh, the pressure's gone. Almost feels like a letdown.</p>

<p>Rossi: Really? Go with that. A letdown.... Let's see what that....</p>

<p>Robin: Because the pressure, the pressure was all there and it built up and then as soon as you release, it's all gone, and it was like for nothing. You know, so.</p>

<p>Rossi: You might have been building up pressure for nothing, you mean?</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like you build up to a point, you're like this and then you explode, and then you're left with nothing.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Unfortunately.</p>

<p>Robin: That's where I get to be...</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. Okay, so this is the point where you need to learn something new. You feel that, see that tension coming, that's like an energy coming up in your system. It wants to do something creative. It wants to break out of the box you're in. It wants to, you to break out of your frustrations. But then, the energy's used up and it doesn't get channeled into...</p>

<p>Robin: Into anything.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's the, now, that's the point where I'd really like to be able to help you. </p>

<p>Robin: Okay.</p>

<p>Rossi: Because in everyday life you've learned this habit of just the tension building up, and then nothing happening. How are we going to channel this energy into a creative process that, you know, that's really one of your talents, whether it's mathematics or art. So I'd like to have you just go with that, go within yourself. This energy that builds up.</p>

<p>Robin: It's just letting go of some of that control. Letting go, not letting it build up.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. Let yourself experience what it's like to let go of control, not let it build up so much. And just let yourself really explore and really feel in your body what's that like. Is it a good feeling or is it a scary feeling or what? </p>

<p>Robin: It's a good feeling.</p>

<p>Rossi: Good. Now go with that good feeling, Robin. This is what we're looking for.</p>

<p>Robin: Because it's a calmness. And if I stay in tune with that, then it keeps the energy level on an even keel. In other words, it doesn't get too tense, but I can hold a fist to have the energy without holding tight.</p>

<p>Rossi: That's right. Bring up your energy and then....</p>

<p>Robin: And then that way it's free to release, but there doesn't feel like there's a big letdown.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes. You let the energy build up and it's free now to explore. And you mentioned that it felt good. I'd like to have you enjoy that good feeling for a couple minutes right now, Robin. Really... If there's anything you deserve, Robin, if anyone deserves to feel good, certainly you do. And you know that. You've done so much for so many people. Now it's time for you to really appreciate...</p>

<p>Robin: The quietness is what I enjoy. The stillness.</p>

<p>Rossi: Let yourself experience that.</p>

<p>Robin: The quietness, the stillness, the things that....</p>

<p>Rossi: So your nature deeply craves, needs quietness in this hurly burly 2-year-old kid and all these people calling you and stuff. So you really... It's nurturing. It's going to be healing for you to have that quietness.</p>

<p>Robin: Quiet. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. Stay with the quietness for another moment or two. And just wondering is it really going to be possible to have an even deeper appreciation of the quietness. Find some ways of bringing it into your life. </p>

<p>Robin: The only way I see bringing it in is, is setting that time.</p>

<p>Rossi: When your child's asleep. That's one very good time. And....</p>

<p>Robin: And even, I guess, maybe, I think, more of like a morning.... Or being able to even, I guess.... We.... I've talked about this before. People can sometimes daydream in the middle of everything going around. </p>

<p>Rossi: Yes.</p>

<p>Robin: I can't.</p>

<p>Rossi: You can't. </p>

<p>Robin: But I think that would be wonderful if I could just take myself away for a little while. You know, just a....</p>

<p>Rossi: Again, it's like the outside world grabs you. So you really need some quietness and some retreat to be able to enjoy the inner peace and inner creative imagination and stuff. Yeah. That's.... And it's out of this that the new idea is going to come, the new feeling is going to come, the other transformations are going to happen. Like you said yourself, you know you can only change yourself. Of course, that's only partially true. I think you might be hooked on the idea that you're supposed to direct those changes. And you know, you're a very bright woman and you have, you know, you've been properly brought up, and so you have a certain ideology, a certain belief of how you should make yourself change, how you.... I want to explode that myth, and I want, I want to explore the idea that there's something that's growing in you autonomously, all by itself. </p>

<p>I think that's what's happening in some of these dreams when they're a little bit frightening to you. Something wants to happen, but you don't, you're not used to doing this. You're used to being hypnotized by the outside world, so you don't know what to do with the new that is spontaneously being generated in you. So I wonder if there's another way in which we can help create that. Are you willing to explore another path and now, we're... Because I just got a cue, by the way, we only have 10 minutes left, but let's use it to the best, okay?</p>

<p>Robin: Okay. Okay.</p>

<p>Rossi: Place your hands up like this this time, Robin. And again, tune in with great sensitivity. And you know, the human body really does have a magnetic field, whether you're experiencing, whether you can experience that or whether this is a metaphor, I don't know.</p>

<p>Robin: No. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: You can experience that magnetic field in some way?</p>

<p>Robin: It's, it's wanting to draw its hands together.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. Allow it to draw the hands together so you're allowing it, but you're not directing it. You're not controlling it. You're just learning how to let your inner nature do something it wants to do. That's it. Nice and slowly. And as those hands continue coming more and more together, I'm going to ask your deep inner nature if it's going to be okay for the next five minutes to simply-that's right-experience allowing something to happen to you from within. And you watch it and you nurture it and you help it. That's it. And allowing your hands to remain there for a moment. </p>

<p>And if it's going to be okay, Robin, to take another step and begin to explore some possibilities for how you're going to continue this kind of learning, allowing yourself to receive your dreams, your intuition, your imagination, if that's going to be okay, will one of those hands, just one, though, Robin, begin drifting down more or less by itself, just to signal "yes." It's really going to be okay to take some time for yourself. That's right. And in that time you're going to take for yourself, you're going to be sensitive, you're going to be receptive to any feelings, any images.</p>

<p>Robin: It still is connected. In other words, it's still, I'm still me.</p>

<p>Rossi: Oh, yes. You're always still you. Yes.</p>

<p>Robin: But I'm allowing.... I haven't lost the inner being, but I'm allowing other things to come in.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes. Did you say you lost the inner me?</p>

<p>Robin: No. I haven't lost it. </p>

<p>Rossi: You haven't lost it. That's right. But you're allowing new things to grow...</p>

<p>Robin: To come in.</p>

<p>Rossi: ...in your inner garden, so to speak. Stay with it now. </p>

<p>Robin: Because it stays connected.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes. Oh, yeah. You're always aware of yourself. You're just opening up, you might say a new little garden plot, a new little addition to the garden of your soul, so to speak. And you wonder what kind of flowers will come up here, or will there be veggies or what. </p>

<p>Robin: It's sort of like saying that if I don't change, it's still going to be okay. You know, in other words, if I don't become the person that makes Ed necessarily happy, it's going to be okay because I'm going to be the person that I'm going to be.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yes, that's right. And this is a way of allowing yourself to become a person in a way that's going to surprise even you, rather than you directing and trying to control yourself. Because if you're trying to control yourself, you're just following an ideology, something you learned 10 years ago from childhood. But if there's going to be a chance to break through this kind of a stalemate, you know, with you and your husband, something truly new has to be created, and we know that's happening in you, as I said, every hour and a half or two. You know, at night, we dream every hour and a half, so that cycle continues. And most people have the wrong idea about psychotherapy. They think that the therapist is supposed to be an expert that's going to tell them what to do. </p>

<p>I mean, you've had a lot of experiences on this ride. I'm not presuming to know what you've got to do, but I go exactly where you brought me today. You said, "Oh, that's, that's where I'm missing something: imagination." And suddenly it became very clear that, exactly. Here we have an extremely intelligent woman. You know, from the outside it looks like you've got a nice marriage, nice child, mortgage; what else do you want? It's that inner garden, your imagination, your creativity that wants evolution. And out of that's going to come a change in your manner without you even knowing it, that your husband's going to pick up in some way that he doesn't even know, and he's going to be curious about it. And it's that curiosity that's going to light the flame, so to speak, that can bring you closer together.</p>

<p>So it's not anything you can tell him to do, and further, it's not anything you can tell yourself to do. But rather, with these exercises today I'm trying to help you open up a space where you can welcome, "Where is the new? Where is the creative? How is that going to come in?" And it usually comes in with your dreams, with your fantasies, with little exercises like...</p>

<p>Robin: The hands.</p>

<p>Rossi: Would that be a nice thing for you to do by the way?</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Rossi: Occasionally, you know, to....</p>

<p>Robin: Sit there and think about that.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah. And today your fists are tight. Maybe tomorrow they're not. But you know, allow that body language, in other words, you're learning how to let your body speak to you. Because, you know, the right hand doesn't often know what the left hand is doing and so on and so forth. So you're getting your deeper nature as well as a deeper evolving spirit nature come to you. So you need an open garden, so to speak, or create some new plots. </p>

<p>Any of this new to you or this....</p>

<p>Robin: It's all new to me.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. Very good. That's what I hope to be able to bring, something really new.</p>

<p>Robin: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Rossi: Yeah, your life, frankly, has gotten in a stale box, so to speak, but you're obviously a creative person, so now you've got to create, take the time out, steal time so you can do this inner work.</p>

<p>Robin: To create within.</p>

<p>Rossi: Have you ever kept a dream journal?</p>

<p>Robin: Uh-uh.</p>

<p>Rossi: I would start doing that. And over, you know, usually don't know what a dream means, but next month, you look back and see, "Oh, that's what my dream meant." And who knows? Sometimes, you might even see in the dream where your soul is going or what you're struggling with. So it becomes like a little record, and you don't have to try to analyze. But over time, it'll be obvious. If you have to try, sit down and figure it out, you know, it's just an intellectual game. But over time, you look at your notes. "Gee, there's a series of dreams. They all have this theme." It becomes obvious to you. </p>

<p>In other words, this is like a mathematics of the fantasy, of the inner mind, you know. You've really got to, you know, mathematic equation, you have to write them out.</p>

<p>Robin: Right. Right.</p>

<p>Rossi: So long as you don't write them out, they can rattle around in your head forever, and you never, they never go to a conclusion. By writing the stuff out, you're going to get over this....</p>

<p>Robin: Frustration. Not knowing.</p>

<p>Rossi: Frustration, yeah. You feel the energy build up. That energy buildup is your health; it's your creativity. But it doesn't know where to go. We've got to create a field for it to go, and dreams, fancies, these private moments, times of your life. So this is a secret place. And you know, you don't necessarily share this with your husband or... Unless it's appropriate, you know. So what else can I do for you today?</p>

<p>Robin: That gives me a lot to think about.</p>

<p>Rossi: Okay. See, if I were continuing to see you, this is exactly where we would set it for: Okay, between now and the next time when I see you again, let's see what happens with this. So you come in next time, and I see what you've done and we talk about it, you know. So that gradually you become more and more of an expert in your own mind-body, how your own fantasy works, where your soul really is going. You'll find yourself getting more sensitive even to your husband and your child as well as yourself. So this is like a growth process we're just starting. Do you think you'll actually continue it even though we're not going to meet again?</p>

<p>Robin: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's definitely....</p>

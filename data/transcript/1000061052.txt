<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>MALE VOICE: 0623016, third interview</p>

<p>PATIENT: It looks like you have a suntan some.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where did you go? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: California.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh my! How long? A week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, three days.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Three days. To the Beach?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: L.A.?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Santa Monica.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Where?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Santa Monica.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. You have relatives there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Can I drink, too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm so dry. I was there in January.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In San Diego. It's like a birthday gift from my parents.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Was it nice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well they-the first week I was there it wasn't really warm but the second week it was nice and there were a lot of college kids on vacation, you know, semester break down there. So it was real nice then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It was a good break.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know, ever since I got back from California I've been, I don't know, I've been seeing a lot of my old friends and everything is very strange. I don't know if I should tell you-things have been really nice lately. With everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me about it. [01:18]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know, I guess friends that I haven't seen for about three or four weeks, we've gone out and done things together. One of my girlfriends, we combined efforts one night and put dinner together over at her apartment and my little boy was there, too. It was just a concoction of everything you'd want to eat, but it was real tasty. We had wine and she has this really great stereo, it was so clear. I hadn't heard anything like that for so long. And, I don't know, just the whole evening was real pleasant. And then some friends, as well as one fellow who's a friend of mine and Robert-I met him through Robert-he came over one night (inaudible 2:11) to riot. He's just got such a funny personality. He can make a joke out of everything and he also plays guitar so.... </p>

<p> And then I think it was one Saturday I went up to see-he had me (inaudible 2:26) with his mom on Villa Ave and I think it was around Valentine's Day and I had to bring him a birthday gift I had forgotten to in January. I got him a Woodstock album (chuckles). We haven't listened to it yet. And I bought his mom some cakes, you know, some Valentine cakes. And then, well, he's been over a couple of times. </p>

<p> One of my friends down on the South Side, I've been talking to her and I stopped over-this was last weekend-and I'm supposed to see her after this session. So, I don't know, just every relationship with my parents and everybody is just going really calm and smooth and I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really like pleasant and smooth?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know if it's just like the time of the year or after bad times come good times or what, but, I don't know. It's just very nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like your life is really full now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I enjoyed staying home one evening (chuckles), you know, just sitting around or lying around. My other sister is coming back from San Francisco this weekend. She and her husband will move back to Clivesdale.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they'll be around now all the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. She always comes over because she's still in school. I think it's her last term, but she'll be popping in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're having really good feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess my mind's been off myself more this year.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 04:17) about other things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know, but I was thinking "Do I need to go to my sessions now?" and everything. But I guess I was just talking to someone and they said going to a therapist-or people basically want someone to talk to, you know, but someone who's qualified and kind of older and knows a little more than they do. (If it's a face guard ph 04:50).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you don't have to have any special thing wrong to go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I gu-well he said it was just once in awhile you really like talking to someone and I don't know-I guess-you don't really want it to be a good friend because their feelings would be involved and you might say something that would bother them. Just somebody who's, you know, more objective.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of like sounds freer to say something like that to (inaudible 05:32)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although, sometimes I find it hard to say things to you because you are young. I guess I could react more toward you as a girlfriend than a counselor or something, you know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you afraid that I'll be too upset by you? [05:53]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not upset, but I guess you'll, I don't know, relate more in a funny way than someone older than me. I mean your reaction might be funny or it might just be a young reaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it wouldn't be the real object of reaction.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, not having seen enough things to really know how it is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much not seeing enough things, but just that the same things might be happening to you, something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What difference would that make, really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I might be embarrassed to tell you, sort of like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like I'm not far away enough for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One way to do that is to have like a screen or something and blurt it all out and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess, I mean-confession (inaudible 07:00). I'm not Catholic (chuckles) but when I went to a Catholic church a couple of times it always got me. I think the priests can (beat ph 07:11) you anyways, can't they?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Is your other client, whatever you want to call it, is the other client a girl, too?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Um. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Man?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. What difference does that make? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know (chuckles). I guess maybe you'd get a male view, too, or something. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I get a lot of different views, you know?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you hear things from him that just relate to him being male or any problems that men get into? You don't have to go into it or anything. I'm just curious.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, I hear you saying that some of the things you're worried about are things that are sort of girl problems.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess, you know, like girl talk. I guess-that would be as far as relating to boys, like a boyfriend or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know those are the kinds of things you worried about when you first came in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, just basically with Robert. I don't have any other problems with fellows, I mean, you know, like a romance-type thing. [08:31]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, to answer your question it isn't-it isn't like problems come in bunches like that like they'd (inaudible 08:42). Sort of like there's each person and the way their glass is. In some way, everybody has the same kinds of problems (inaudible 08:55) different for everybody the way they feel is different, how they're feeling. The category (inaudible 09:04).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I always do, I put things into categories. I think I have told you before I always put things into categories. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, people too, I guess. Something's not (inaudible 09:20), you know, and I don't want to be in a category. I just want to be the one that's free to move about and change and stuff. I guess maybe because I-hand on the handle and four sides are going-full of people are changed and going around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it box you in? Do you think about yourself that way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a category or...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 09:46)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sometimes, you know, I think I want to but then when I also think that I want to be unrelated-a case of being egotistical-but being able to change freely and to be anything in many people's minds. That's kind of puzzled me, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the category that you want to get free of. What category do you have a problem with? [10:16]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't-I'm not really sure about it anymore, but I guess it would be-you know everybody says middle-class type thing, but I guess that would be it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't mind so much being in it, but I hate a person who comes up and, I mean, says that you're middle class. Not when they really know you, but because of the way you dress and everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like I all dress all different ways, I guess. You know, I've been here wearing skirts and sweaters and stuff. But I don't know, I guess I do the same thing, too, to other people. I guess people always will. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does it mean being middle class-to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess dressing a certain way and thinking a certain way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What kind of a way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess it's been drummed into my head and a lot of other people's heads, you know, living in a house in the suburb with kids and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the thing that you're trying to break away from? Are you trying to be more free in the way you are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I have broken away in a sense. I mean, I don't live there anymore and I don't have a big house and a car. But I don't really mind going out to the suburbs and seeing my parents and people. But, you know, some of my friends say that-I guess originally I was from Ithaca and some of my friends still think of me as being from Ithaca and I'm saying that maybe they do it to tease me (chuckles), I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do they say when they tease you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well this one person says-well this was a couple of years ago, I guess-"The minute I saw you I said Ithaca to myself." (chuckles) I know he was kidding but it was-this was after I told him I was from Ithaca, but it could have been any suburb, but I think he meant to say "The minute I saw you I knew you were from Ithaca." (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ithaca. What does it mean for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Umm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just means a suburb where I grew up and at the time I was there I didn't-you know I was-I guess I was just plain content. I didn't know too much about anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You really feel like you've moved a long ways from there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, in most-in most-in most ways I think I have But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're kind of proud of having moved away from it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much proud. I'm just glad that I got to, you know, see other things, you know what I mean? See different cities and be able to actually do what I wanted, I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like if you had just gone along in the groove. [13:21]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm glad that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 13:23)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, possibly, yeah. I'm glad that, you know, I did get a chance to change my mind and actually know there was a difference, too. It's like some of my girlfriends are just doing the exact same things that their mothers are doing. I mean, like even getting their hair fixed once a week and everything like that. And I don't think they even had a chance to sample some of the things or even change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's been an issue for you to see all that-all these (inaudible 13:57).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But I hear you saying also that it's been a real relief not to be able to just walk into one of these lives that people have been pressured into.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My mother is -I wouldn't say my mother is like somebody you could call middle class, you know, like a prototype or something. My mother's-I think she's a very different, unique woman. She was brought up in a small town in North Dakota and I-any type of, you know, I guess, middle class thing that she would have-a value-maybe she would get it from my dad, you know. Just him harping at her. But he wasn't brought up in a middle class home at all, either. He just acquired all these different things and-so I guess for them it's coming a long way, too, to what they are. And they had the chance to change and some other things, too. But they didn't really want me to change so much. You know what I mean?</p>

<p> Or my sister-well, my sisters haven't really changed that much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, it's like it's a little hard to make those changes because they don't really want you to. But you're pretty sure that you're doing the right thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what I say to that? I guess, you know, some of the thing that I did (inaudible15:28) or, you know, they didn't turn out as well or the way I wanted them too, but I guess I say to them "I did it already." I can't go back and tell them I wish I was something else. That's part of growing up, too, accepting what's happened. I mean to yourself.... But when I-I think my dad still tries and tells me how to do things. Or like now he says "Correct your life" and stuff and I just realize that he's always going to be doing to me and all my sisters and if it doesn't turn out he'll just have to take care of the rest.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, I guess part of the problem for you is that in a way you're always being pulled to come back to the fold, or something like that, buy your dad. And your mom sort of got boxed in, too. You're really trying hard to find some other plain.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, I always have this feeling, well, I was-when I was in high school, I always did everything my mom and dad wanted. I guess-the model daughter. I did everything-you know, you'd come home from school and do all that junk that they wanted, but I've always had this fear-I still have it-that I'm going to be roped back.... I don't have it so much now as I did the past couple of years that I'm going to be roped in by them and do what they want me to again. Just like now, having Adrian, I guess, being a parent or a mother, I mean, has kind of made me see that I've got to take care of a baby. I've got to take care of myself and my baby and not cater to my mother or other people so much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Adrian is kind of liberating you from your mom.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way, yeah. From my parents. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like he makes you responsible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't-I think the one good thing about Adrian is he did make me much more responsible than I've ever been. I guess in that sense, it's a good thing that happened to me. I don't know, my girlfriend, she's a social worker and we were with her last week and she said that she was really surprised how I handled the whole thing (Phone rings)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello. Um Hm. Can I call you back? (inaudible 18:10) Bye.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want me to leave it on, hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I left the thing where you can reach... I forget what I was saying. Oh yeah, my girlfriend, she said that she was surprised how I handled the whole thing and she's kind of semi living with her boyfriend now and she keeps saying she'd like to have a baby and I know I kind of feel wise about the whole thing. I said don't have one unless it's a night and day whim. You know, something you really want that you're in the mood for. But she said I've given her confidence. And I said you don't know the half of it until you live with a child twenty-four hours a day and like I...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Big job.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it-I never even dreamed of things that I would have to do until I had Adrian. And I realize that things are going to get tougher for him and me as he gets older. You know, taking care of the things that he wants. She's gone through a chance in her lifestyle and marriages, too. She was basically worried about the tag 'illegitimate' and I just-I wonder about it a lot, too, and think I told her that I have to, right now, I have to kind of prepare my mind and Seth's mind-kind of like two to nothing isn't going to make that much difference to us, but if anybody else ever says anything to him, you know, if they even know or anything I guess you have to prepare him to handle things as he grows up. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of protect him from being hurt by people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, protect him and to give him the right idea just about life and how he was born and that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really important to you that he not (inaudible20:17) wrong time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much that he really get hurt by it, but whether Robert and I even get married, I don't know, but I think I told you before but a good majority of his generation will be illegitimate and I don't know what will happen to the others, but... I had told my girlfriend, it's not just something that's a whim or a fancy as you learn after the whole thing happens to you. You really learn that. I told her also that-well, a long time ago I told her that I guess that Adrian and I would just have to live from day to day because I have never had any child psychology courses or any teaching courses, you know, that type of thing or nursing school. And that we would have to live from day to day. And I guess we are in a way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like in the beginning you were learning (inaudible 21:23).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But now I guess I see long-range plans for his mental attitude and things. As far as the physical and material things, I guess that's still day to day. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that how it's hurting you or is that just sort of the way it is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In my mind or really? No, I think it's really the way it is. I guess I kind of like it because my dad always made these long range plans and he used to drive me and my sisters really crazy. It really got to be too much, you know he'd plan and Oh, God!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were always-everything was all set out where you were going to go before you got there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think a lot of the fun is doing things on the spur of the moment. Even going on trips. If you can-if there's hotels and motels, you know, you do what you can if you want to reserve something. But I think most of the fun is doing things on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess it's like if you make too many plans it can kind of cut out getting to do the things you feel like doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: My-mine always changed, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm. And that's what change means for you? Being free to change? That you can decide you want a different thing? You want to feel free to decide you want a different thing and you would have expected to still be able to do that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just-I just want to feel free in my mind most of all. I mean even learning through Adrian-having Adrian and taking care of him and being with him, really freedom is the most important thing you can have. Whether it's in a country or for yourself, it really-people really don't know that much until they have it taken away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This girlfriend really kind of looks to you as someone who really knows about the hard decisions in life...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, she never did before. She's older than I am. She was my roommate for six months and she's older and she's very bright so I always kind of went to her. She was always the kind of older sister type and would tell me things. I guess she kind of was-there was one time where she just stopped and thought about what I said and she really realized it had some weight-carried some weight. [24:16]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess, you know, part of-part of-a really important part of what you're saying is that you've really moved a long way from your friends and your parents...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, this past week, maybe it's because I'm happy again and everything. But, yeah, I think I've really moved a long way-I've really-like the commercial, 'You've Come a Long Way, Baby' (chuckles). But I think I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like the pressure on you to go back is getting less strong or maybe it's because you have some real reality now, having Adrian. It's sort of like your life is getting definition somehow. This new life that you've created.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. And I guess because now I'm-I have to be really strong, sort of a mature adult. I have to make the decisions for him and me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. It's a little different than not being like your parents, but you're beginning to be something that's your own, now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I matured late. I think you could get that impression from what I told you. I just wasn't able to come to my own decisions until-God, it must have been about my second or third year in college. You know most kids rebel, I suppose, in their teens, when you're in high school you rebel a little against your parents. I didn't do it until I was in college, the last years of my college. And my parents didn't expect it from me at that time and I kind of threw them, I think. And I'm still throwing them because my three other sisters did rebel then. And it kind of mixed things up for them a little.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel sort of like you missed something in high school?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Some kind of learning?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, learning and fun and that type of thing. Because, you know, my mom had arthritis at the time and she was going through operations and my dad had eye operations, too. I think, yeah, in a lot of ways I missed things. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think are the most important things you missed when you think about yourself now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then, you mean? I guess the girlfriends and just hanging around with kids in groups after school, that type of thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just really having some friends that you kind of fool around with. Not too serious friends.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I guess-well, I had one good friend-a girlfriend-I had a real good friend. And I had-I did have groups but mostly on weekends or something and we didn't do too much during the week. But I still felt at that time that my parents needed me to help and that type of thing. I guess that kind of did it to me, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm. It sounds like you felt really obligated to them. You never really felt part of the ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I felt guilty if I didn't help them and that type of thing. Because my mom, you know. Because my other sisters wouldn't. They didn't want to and I always felt bad for my mom, so I'd help (inaudible 27:42).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way the feelings you've been having the last couple of months of really feeling part of sometimes a group of friends that kind of come and go and they're easy to be with and they can do things together. It's the thing that you've always wanted.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know all the, you know things are fitting and, you know, just clicking and fitting it all in together lately. I guess before I kind of felt lost in the middle and I didn't really have anybody I felt comfortable with at the time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of alone in a way and all kinds of things going on around but you weren't into them. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And maybe it bothered me more because I have Adrian now and the feeling of not being comfortable with my friends hadn't happened for awhile back. I guess maybe before I even had him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I've always said to myself that I know gladness and good times and bad times (inaudible 28:45) intermixed and I always know that things will get better and will change again but I guess maybe during the times that they're not so hot, I just reflect-I'm more reflective and thing about things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I go back to what you said? You said-once you had said you had been feeling kind of alone. Is that like you were afraid...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that you-since you had a child you would never really plug into anything?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...well, be with old friends again because they were doing something completely different from what I was doing and I just didn't think that we had anything in common.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, that's the best thing because (inaudible 29:37) you can be doing your own thing no matter how different it is you'll still be able to have people around you you can feel warm about. Feel good even though you are all doing very different kinds of things. I guess the reason I mention that is, in a way, it seems like the boxes again. You don't have to get boxed in to have good times. You don't have to do it everybody else's way. That's not one of the rules for having a good time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, yeah, you don't think about that really when you're having a good time, it's just-like I said-when you're-when something's bothering you. I guess, I don't know how I would feel now if Robert were here and this was happening. Maybe my mind would be off him and there would be a lot of kids coming and going. I don't know how that would relate to him. But I kind of feel a little differently about him. His aunt came over Sunday for dinner. It's his dad's younger sister and she told me a whole bunch of things about him that I never knew and I don't think he even knows about because it happened to him when he was real young. From what she said, she made it sound like I should be real understanding and not let anything he does bother me because everything that he does stems from things that have happened to him. You understand?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he's not responsible for anything he does?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Or, you know, something kind of just snapped and after that he was different. But I still find that hard when I think about it, to accept her statements and just do that, react that way, towards him. I don't know. It sounded logical and it all fit perfectly, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, it's sort of like he doesn't mean it when he gets angry and horrible but...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but that doesn't keep him from actually being angry and horrible.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He wrote me a letter in the last weekend and there was this one line in there that said I tormented him. And I haven't written to him. We had come back from our trip and I hadn't written to him. And he said I tormented him. I don't even know what I did or said to him. But I think it's the whole situation with Adrian that he meant. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told his aunt and she said "Well, that's good. He needs to stop-he needs someone to really get to him." ...really upset him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She really wants you to stick with him and try to make him (inaudible 32:31).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she said that the nicest thing that we could do for her was to get married and take care of Adrian but she still doesn't know everything that's gone one. I don't really know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She has good intentions, but in a lot of ways you know better what's going to happen and what you have to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Although, like I said, the things she did say about Robert were very logical and could be real-be the real reason that he does some things. I don't know. [33:09]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that could change your feelings about it when he does them. Like you wouldn't be so hurt. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, now I could understand it, but when he's actually doing it I guess it could be hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because he's still actually still hurting. He's still being angry at something. You still have to live with that even if something bad happened to him when he was three years old.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, you know, like, I don't know-I still think when the person's actual facial expressions and movements and what they say, you know, it's there. And at that time you don't put all that stuff together, you know. Oh, this happened to him when he was little and that's the reason he's acting that way now. You just don't unless you're some kind of psychiatrist or a saint, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's really hard if you know someone doesn't mean it, if they're being really awful to you to have to live with that and just take it. I guess especially if you feel like you're supposed to take it because something bad happened to them-they have problems.</p>

<p>PATIENT: There was a line on TV last night. It really got me. The-this man had said to this woman when she was dead-he said "You gave a lot and took nothing. You were a very stupid woman." (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it really got me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What did you think? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I just thought, God, I wouldn't want anyone to say that about me after I go or I don't even think I want anyone to say that about me now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you sort of feel like that with Robert.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes I do. But I have asked things of him. That's when he can't put up with it or it really bothers him. I think-you know what he is? He is a self-centered-and you're not-I'm not-I don't know, maybe I am growing up now. But he even admits it in his letter he talked about he says-all I have to write is me, me, me. You go (inaudible 35:25) me. I guess he knows it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 35:31)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe he needs to talk to a therapist or something. He won't, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You asked him about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I guess maybe I mentioned it. I said why don't-because he said he had all these things he was thinking about and all these problems and I said "Why don't you go talk to someone?" He said "No." He likes to tell everyone he's in pain and he knows he is so nothing's going to help.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like he doesn't really want to do anything to make something different. He just goes (inaudible 36:06). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think he really likes to be, you know, I think he likes to put people on him and really act crazy and stuff like that. Not that he does every day, but I think he likes to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like that's his way of dealing with (inaudible 36:24) it sounds like. He just acts freaky and then he can't (inaudible 36:28)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah (chuckles) we went-right before Adrian was born we went to the social worker and usually when Robert meets people he's real quiet and very polite and everything. Well, this one time, he just did this, I don't know, this whole act, he just breathed down rocks and was really making a mess of things. Putting on a big show for her and everything. And I said "He just blew it." And then I sat back and let him do it, you know, everything and she called me a couple days later and we talked about him-but I knew he'd do something like that. He does it every once in a while.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he do it to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think when he gets... What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does he do it to you, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well not-well, in the beginning he did, but now because I know when he's going to act or something like that. But he'll do it to people, you know, that he's just met if he gets-maybe if he's scared. I mean, if he's afraid of meeting them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said at the time when he did something was he scared?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. When he's scared of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of a way to keep them off somewhat?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess. I just let him go ahead and do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel when he's doing it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel sorry for him. I don't know, I kind of feel pity and I wish he wouldn't do it, but he does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like it's his showing how-that he can't deal with something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe-yeah, maybe it's his way dealing with it. [38:14]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like such a good way for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like such a good way to deal with things to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I think he's making a fool out of himself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess maybe he knows it, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like you'd like it better if he could show people that side of himself that you're in love with and things like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, with some people he does, I guess. But I guess it doesn't-that's with people that, you know, are more like that themselves. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's his prime...</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a lot of different people. I guess we all are. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard for you, I guess, when you admire him to feel like he's going to blow it with everybody that he thinks (inaudible 39:09) and not let anybody else see what the good things are in him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I don't know, maybe he wants to belong so badly or something. Maybe he wants to be friends-at least he tries to be real hard. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 39:27)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well he has a lot of friends and makes friends like on the spot. But whether they stay his friends for a long time or not, I don't know. But he does make friends. A lot of people he offends when he first meets them because I guess he does come on so strong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems to me like it would really be hard to feel like somebody was really neat in some ways, you know, somebody you could look up to in some ways and then when you took them places if they never showed it to other people, you'd always have to sit there and think how freaky they were acting and how you knew they were pretty good but they never show anyone else. It's almost embarrassing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, sometimes. But, I guess it's more-it's like I'm embarrassed for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. I guess when you have doubts about him, too, if he acts weird with everyone else it makes it harder for you to know if he's really...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, he doesn't act weird with everyone. I guess maybe it's where he is-you know, the group of people he's with or something. I think with-like somebody who's not a hippie or freak or something, you know, establishment-type people he'll like to do something to astound them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you, it's sort of like you can live with either world.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can live with either world, but I don't think I fit in fully with either one. Do you know what I mean? Whereas I think he fully fits in with one world and he kind of refuses to fit into another one all the way. I mean, he might even go out of his way to do something that would show them that he's not from their world. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way it's like you have a little more freedom to move around when you're alone than when you're with him. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it boxes you in to that-you're away from the suburbs or something-to be with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true. And also because I guess he makes me feel uncomfortable, too, if I don't act exactly how he is. Or he'll always comment on it if I'm not. That may be the reason he always comments on it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because he will sort of let you have it if you start moving around too much.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so much let's me have it. He'll say something. But I think in a way he kind of admires certain things that I have hung onto from the suburbs. [42:43]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you're left alone, though, when you kind of just fly through these categories you just have your own (inaudible 42:55). You have your dad sort of yanking you into the suburbs and Robert kind of yanking you away. When they all leave you alone, you just sort of float and it's kind of all right and then when either of them pulls too hard you start wondering who the hell you are and what you're doing anymore. Then you ought to give up something-start feeling like you don't know for sure completely.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Specifically, like when I'm with Robert, he'll-I don't mind doing all these things which I do most of the time anyways. But when it-it starts you know, like you have to live with something, like drugs for example. I don't use drugs and I don't like anybody else to, you know? My dad was a doctor and I just know a lot about drugs and stuff and when people start using-saying "Well you have to take a little of this grass or something" and stuff like that, I just don't like it. And I don't know, a lot of people-they don't really say anything if you don't do it-if you don't take drugs-like they're friends and everything, but sometimes I feel like he thinks "Oh, you should do this because it's the way I am and you're with me and this is the way you should be doing things."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way you see yourself as being sort of like your mother is with your dad with Robert. Like your dad's always pulling your mom into his straight world and Robert's always (inaudible 44:48) the way you see it in neither place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, my mom-I think I'm a little stronger than my mom is. Specifically because my dad, you know, he's my father and we had other kids in the family and I think I've gotten some traits from my dad like that. That I am stronger than my mom. And with Robert, he's never really forced me to do anything that I haven't wanted to. I don't know, I just-I think since I've known him I've gotten stronger and well, actually, I think my opinion carries little weight with him but he doesn't like to tell me or let me know about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's sort of like you're getting more and more sure all the time about how you want to live and stuff. And when these people pull on you it's kind of a less strong pull in a way. Because you know more and more what you want. I imagine it would still be hard to have, even if nobody's really yelling, to have him saying all the time what you're doing is wrong.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It stems back from when I was younger and I guess I am feeling bad about it because I don't want to hurt my parents. Maybe I even feel a little guilty about it. But I say in my mind the way that things are is the way (inaudible 46:30).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like whatever you do you have to start in your own mind by feeling (inaudible 46:36) and you do what you can with that. You can't make things go away, make your past any different than it was or anything like that. Do you feel these things?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, see my parents don't really know that I-well, they do now. They know. They don't really feel like they've done that do me. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They don't really know that all those things happened. They just don't feel it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's kind of like the stresses you were feeling were things you just had to live with yourself. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I-I told them the way I felt. You know, at that time, and I don't blame them now. I'm not trying to make them feel bad about it. I just told them. I said "That's the way I feel or felt in those years and that's just the way things are."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, there's a sort of edge to what you're saying and it seems like a lot of times people when they say things to you you have to keep reminding yourself that, in a way, you're in charge of your life and that things (inaudible 47:54). Something like that you feel pulled in such different directions and, in a way, both directions and people at times may see things different from the way they really are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I've always felt that people were always trying to tell me things. In college, whenever my roommate-we were friends in Junior College-she was my roommate in our second year. I always felt like she was trying to control me and it used to bother the heck out of me. And I guess that maybe I would just do things to-on purpose-to kind of show her that she didn't have control over me. But I guess in the act of trying to show her that she didn't have control over me, in a way she did. You know, if I had something to show her I didn't-or she didn't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if you had to keep playing around...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that bothered me too, that I had to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just keep playing off her (inaudible 48:59). In a way that's the same girl who now sort of looks up to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, this is (inaudible 49:05)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of with Robert that's changed. It seems sort of like nobody says out loud that they give you credit for doing your own thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, every once in awhile they do, but I don't know. I guess maybe before they didn't. I don't know, he used to like-a strike and stuff-when I'd (inaudible 49:31). I'm kind of flighty and a bubble-brain and it's an act on my part, too. I don't know. That's what happens. Or maybe they just have-I think it's that they have a lot of self-esteem and they have a lot of pride in what they are, no matter what they are. You know, a lot of people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're beginning to get some of that yourself, it sounds like. Sort of like... [50:00]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said a couple of times today, things like somebody really does listen, you know, even if they don't say so, when you have an opinion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, they've listened before but I guess they never really said anything afterwards to make me realize that they did listen. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You figure everybody else has more self-esteem than you do sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think a lot of the time. Like my girlfriend, Shirley, who is the teacher. I think Robert does and I know that my dad does. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does that feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That they have more-well, I, you know, it doesn't bother me that they have it. I guess it's just at times they related to me and they I guess came on so strong, you know, me, me, me, like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like you would...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it got my (inaudible 51:10)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible 51:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or when I felt bad or maybe-not neglected, but when I just felt that like maybe Adrian was neglected. Say with Robert lately when he's just thinking of himself and-not me so much-but you know, not even Adrian. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, what you're saying is that this not having enough self-esteem for you is no problem. You don't like all these ego-trippers all around you. You sort of like things to be little more...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...considering of other people's feelings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, I know in my own mind that I have some, like, you know, like pride and know what I can do, you know, my limitations and that type of thing. And I-if I usually don't go out and talk about them to everybody. It's the same with these other two people. Maybe my dad-he's the one person I've never been able to figure out. But say with Shirley and Robert. They come on very strong and very egotistical and everything but I think in their minds, their hearts, they are weaker than I am. They have more things that they wonder about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, like your saying, is the difference between how you really feel in front of them. [52:40]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or maybe it's none of the stuff. I don't know. Because they say, like, you know, if you're self-confident you usually don't have to go to extremes to show something, prove something. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that feels right for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but if you're kind of in doubt and you're lacking in a lot of self-confidence, you need to go overboard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, part of this thing with these other people is that when you're with them, you really feel pretty sure about who you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes, but you know what people like that can do? They talk so well, forget about their mind for a minute, they talk so well and put on and do their act so well-or you know, what they say kind of leaves you in doubt then, that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Sort of like they really-it's not so much that they're so sure of themselves but they really act like they're real sure of themselves. And you can't really act like that even if you feel like that. Not a contest or something when you get together. Like you know why you're doing what you're doing but you can't describe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's a strange contest but there was one key word you said that could have happened. What I was going to say-I forgot what it was. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should I make it up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Should I replay that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you want to-it's just a few words back. I don't even know if it will come to me. [54:19}</p>

<p>(recording stops) [54:20]</p>

<p>(recording begins again [54:42]</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I, you know, I can act like that but when I do act like that I know it's fake inside me and I know that-and I just feel-then I feel super above the rest. You know what I mean? I just feel like I-like a-I just feel like my head is extra-(inaudible 55:05). And I don't feel good about it. I don't like to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it's not a natural thing for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's not natural but it's more of a feeling that I know its not natural and then I just get super-super egotistical and you know, really act like a jerk about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way, you're saying you don't like yourself when you act that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it's really-it's an uncomfortable style for you. Like you can put it on but you really lose yourself (inaudible 55:40) after. Like that's not you (inaudible 55:43).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely lose myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way that means (inaudible 55:51) is really (inaudible55:59)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just being myself, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like planning (inaudible 56:06) is really a big deal. I mean you can do it until it's just all out of hand and you feel really (inaudible 56:12). Or you don't do it at all. It's not (inaudible 56:17). How do you feel about yourself when you're doing that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: When I (inaudible 56:27)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I-this goes back to the (inaudible 56:33) when I know how to ask for it and I have to or when I know I'm right and I can carry it off. But other times I like when I know I'm doing it sometimes I add a few other touches and stuff and get really dramatic about it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You didn't feel this (inaudible 56:55)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just found myself doing (inaudible 56:58). I guess more than anything else, I like another person to be honest, you know? I really do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess in a way the problem with that-it's that (inaudible 57:10) control the situation so bad you're forced to put on a show.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Almost that make it into a show and the other person does something whereby it becomes a show.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What did you say? It's not really a show?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-not-no. I don't usually when I fight I won't make it a show unless like you said it is so bad that it becomes one. Or the other person does something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does it get to-how does it (inaudible 57:47)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like I'll say things or the manner in which I say them, you know. And I do it so that it really isn't me. You know, putting on a veneer to do it-to get your point across or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like saying...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or playing a role or part to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sort of like doing it a certain way for effect or something along those lines. (inaudible 58:18)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well maybe no one would believe it because of the way I said it. [58:27]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to take out more of his way of doing it. I guess it's a hard thought about that. If you're defending something you believe in and somebody wants you to do it a different way. He has to feel a little sure that you're right somehow. If you have to fight no matter where you go... Somehow that's less easy somehow. </p>

<p>PATIENT: But sometimes the other person doesn't know that I'm putting on that much of an act. You know what I mean? They think it's a natural happening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 59:05)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sometimes-no, I mean enjoy knowing that they don't know that this isn't the way that you're really doing something. In that way, I guess I never would want to be an actress.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess what you're saying to me is that you don't like being put in these situations where you have to manipulate to get what you want. But you can do it and you can win, but it doesn't feel good inside (inaudible 59:41).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know how I win. Basically (inaudible 59:49). I don't like when people do it either. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 59:54)</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I think the most I've ever done it with was Robert. Not that I do it that often.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really-it's really nice for you for these friends now, it's just easier and you can just be yourself if you want. You don't have to act and feel like you're (inaudible 1:00:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not so far. I just feel like all parts of me just one to the other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sort of sounds like in the last couple of months thinks have-inside you are gelling in some kind of way. All these friends you talk about-all different people (inaudible 1:00:50). </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it seem like when you're upset sometimes you feel like a lot of people going in different directions. And when you feel good, it feels like you're a lot of different people but all with a single (inaudible 1:01:01).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know what does that? I think it's the actual happening-the reality of being right there with the whole scene, you know, the people, and not having them be far away so that you can think about them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It gets back to when you're doing something-and I was doing something that's really nice.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Say, if I enjoyed my work, I'd feel that way, too. But, you know, if you're at a job that you don't like and then you start thinking again of what you could be doing instead of (inaudible 1:01:43).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I guess, it seems to me like there (inaudible 1:01:53) some kind of (1:01:55) sort of freeing for you. Then you can move because you don't want to lose yourself (inaudible 1:02:02) could be a little bit different but still be you. (inaudible 1:02:14)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I hope so. I think I have.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When you talk about having been a slow maturer, you said...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I would change in spurts. I would change and be that way for a long time and then, you know, another sudden change and then be that way for awhile. Because don't think I ever recall doing anything that my-I don't think I ever recall doing anything real slowly. I've always done it real fast, you know, spontaneous and that's, you know, (inaudible1:02:56)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's sort of like having a time when (inaudible 1:03:08).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think so, I hope so. Maybe. (inaudible 1:03:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you feel about that? Is that-do you want it to come (inaudible 1:03:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's see. I think I'd enjoy it for awhile and all, but, you know, I don't know for sure that I'm going to stay this way for a long time. You know, next week maybe I'll feel blue or something, but I think I definitely like plateaus more than the actual (inaudible 1:05:47)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The changes are really dramatic I guess...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I can't really see what the outcome is or what's really happening during that with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sort of like losing where you are sometime during that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like, I guess it's like a tornado being blown around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this feeling now you have is sort of like having gone through some of the anger and you landed on your feet (inaudible 1:04:13) your feeling will go away? Or...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not that it will go away, but I'll start thinking again about, maybe, you know maybe this is just for short time. I guess mostly it's just like the mental, you know like the anguish and the pain in my mind. The empty space of not knowing what's going on or where I'm headed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not really changing itself that's so hard. It's really feeling unhappy that feels hard. [1:05:04] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I am changing. I guess I like some type of stability-stability in myself. Something anyways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does it feel too easy? I'm just trying to get what you said-that this is sort of a final point you've gone through in your life. I don't mean like the last point, but (inaudible 1:05:34) Getting used to not having anything permanent with Robert, which I guess is (inaudible 1:05:42)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think the next time I think anything, you know, starts up again, I think it would probably be the summer when he comes back to New York. If I can get across to him how I am, you know, what things-I really like what's going on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if he would respect that you sort of (inaudible1:06you're your own, you know, what we do here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sort of-your fears about the summer-(inaudible 1:06:24)</p>

<p>PATIENT: My fears, I guess, are just how we'll get along with each other as far as-well, my fears are if we will get along, period. (inaudible 1:06:45) Well, I don't know if we'll be living together or anything, but just if we can get along, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just get along means that he'll let you be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, feel comfortable together again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean-you know-be-enjoy being with each other, being honest about how we feel about each other. Being honest how we really area about-I don't know, I guess being honest about ourselves, you know, how we really are. Each part.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In a way-I'd like to try to say what I think you've been saying to just make sure I've got it. It's sort of like it's something about where you are now, but it's like having a real sense of confidence and you've (inaudible 1:07:35) about yourself (inaudible 1:07:42) and where you have worries, it's not worries about who you are really, but about whether the world will be the way you want it sometimes. You know, sort of like your life's going along, but your worries are worries like can you stay that way and still have the peaceful relationship with your friends, chatting with your parents and everybody else that seems to be kind of (inaudible 1:08:09).</p>

<p> And it sort of like that's what your friends are looking up to you about now. You've carved out this sort of like now .</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well and they're (inaudible1:08:29) maybe this is momentary stuff. But I just, I don't know. I guess I do feel more secure about myself and Adrian. Mentally at least. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really sounds like it's not so much that you're afraid you don't know what you're doing with other people, you know, all these other people and getting mixed up in all that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like when everything is peaceful you really do like where you are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you know where it is. I mean, it's a place, (inaudible 1:09:00)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, for my first session I came away not so much depressed, but I came away feeling I knew I had to do certain things and I had to do them right away, you know, related to people and I was-well, I guess I was feeling kind of pessimistic and blue. And then the last session I felt much more optimistic or I felt better in a way . Well this-I guess today I do, too. I just say I've been-I just feel better. I've come away from the last two sessions feeling better. But, you know, like, they've all been different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it feeling most of the time?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In one way, I'm not thinking about anything. Nothing's on my mind right now. I'm not hassling about anything. I guess I kind of feel peaceful this time. I guess I kind of feel happy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's nothing depressing, you can just go home and be you. But you don't have to feel bad to come in.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I just-well, I didn't really bad-well, this time. I don't think I felt bad either of the other times, I'm just saying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I didn't mean to interpret it..</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I guess I felt the-I guess the first time, mostly apprehensive about myself and my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not, I didn't mean that you did, I just mean that you said something earlier. You can come whenever you want, whether your (son's ph 1:11:01) feeling crappy or not. And I don't have to decide whether things are bad or good or anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well when I came, when I was coming here I wasn't real elated on (Neal ph 1:11:01) and me. I felt comfortable, I felt peaceful but I guess talking about it I realized I was pretty happy this time, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Do you want to call me next week? Or do you want (tape ends abruptly)</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: In general it's been hurting. It's been really, really frustrating. The thing is like when I eat or something I will end up using both hands and like I can keep my hand in the wrist bracelet but then it feels like all of a sudden pain is shooting up my arm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it's a little bit unpredictable or the pain just hits later?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like I mean after doing it for a while sort of thing; I've been eating for like 20 minutes and there is the pain sort of thing. Because I don't feel it instantly, it doesn't instantly stop me from using it. It's just like if I would only use my left hand it would be so slow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's really hard not to use your dominant hand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, if I'm typing I'm still really using both hands. I need them both to get dressed and then this morning I just decided to skip brushing my hair altogether and pin it up. I was [ ] (inaudible at 00:01:22) and brushing my hair it would have had to have been my right hand and it would have been reaching very far and hurting a lot. I'm just so completely frustrated at this point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's understandable. Hopefully the doctor on Monday will have useful suggestions and ideas and be able to understand what is going on. 00:02:02</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I hope so. I have no clue if they're going to take x-rays or anything. I ended up missing work for Wednesday and Thursday just so I wasn't risking it. Also, with something physical I, in theory, go to work until my hand starts hurting on Wednesday; and Wednesday morning my hand was hurting so I was like, "Okay, I guess that 'until my hand starts hurting' already started."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is the pain killer helping? Are you using the Vicodin? 00:02:45</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm using the Vicodin and I'm using the Ibuprofen. I haven't used it yet today because I didn't want to take them on an empty stomach. They don't erase the pain completely. It's hard to tell when they're working if I'm suffering pain. I guess the ibuprofen is not really so much for the pain as for the swelling and anti-inflammatory stuff, but the Vicodin is . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's supposed to be for pain.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But then either that or it's not really helping me. I don't know if it's just because my pain is bad or because it happens after I've started [ ] (inaudible at 00:03:23) or something like that. If I take a Vicodin - like when I went out to dinner Monday evening I took a Vicodin and two Advils right before we left, and so then we had dinner. Halfway through dinner, I guess towards the end of dinner, the pain was shooting through my arm after having used my hand all that time. 00:03:46</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's hard to know if it's helping it somewhat or if it's giving you more time before you start feeling it. Hard to know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I ended up having to skip my music performance on Wednesday. [ ] (inaudible at 00:04:06) It was just like I really don't feel like singing while I'm in pain and I'm in pain right now. The whole getting there and getting back - I just didn't feel like dealing with the whole cab ride there, cab ride back and getting the money out of my wallet, etc. etc. so I didn't even try.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been really limiting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How has your mood been? How are you coping with it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's gone okay. Not right now. I'm just sort of like . . . because I didn't get enough sleep last night and I think is mostly due to Sydney's insomnia and I'm trying to - not last night but the night before, we actually went to bed at 9:30 or something, slept until 6:30 in the morning. He woke me up yesterday at 7:30 in the morning. It would have been last night, he didn't get to bed until late; I ended up getting to bed at like 3:30 because he had been in . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's still pretty late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. He was at his game until like 12:15, got home, and then we watched a Stargate and then we watched another Stargate, then he was hungry and then he was feeling really depressed. I didn't want to leave him by himself so I watched another episode with him instead of just going to bed earlier. I wanted him to feel better even though I knew it was going to be that I wouldn't get enough sleep. He didn't get to bed until seven and now we have to go down to my parents' this afternoon; and he is supposed to be driving because I shouldn't be driving, so I'm not sure . . . I guess what I have to do is just let him sleep until one or something so he's gotten a decent amount of sleep and then drive down. We also needed to get clothing for the both of us; it would be mostly for him but I need it, too. We were going to go clothes shopping so we'd have some nice outfits to wear because like his nice slacks are somewhere in the room full of other things and stuff and not easily accessible as far as I know. I guess he'll just have to wear jeans and a nice shirt or something. That's really the only thing I can think of doing at this point because I don't think we have time to clothes shop and get down there, especially if we have got to get down there before rush hour. It's just kind of in mind that I've not gotten enough sleep last night. He also woke me up at seven when he got back to bed. He was like, "It's seven and I haven't fallen asleep yet." I'm just like, "Go to sleep. We'll deal with it tomorrow. [ ] (inaudible at 00:07:27) or something."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has that been happening a lot that you're up until . . . ?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not that I'm up the entire time usually. If I'm up that late I at least have the ability to sleep in or something. Usually I'll try to go to bed at an at least somewhat decent hour if I have to wake up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you consider a somewhat decent hour? 00:07:51</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess a somewhat decent hour would be more like two or maybe one. I can often be up until two, but it's not bad if I don't have to wake up until ten or something. He is the one because he has less things to do during the day. He will be getting less sleep and stuff. I kept on telling him, "You need to tell your psychiatrist about this." I guess he mentioned it last time and then last time the psychiatrist was like, "Oh, the new medicine should also help with the insomnia." It's been like either it hasn't or it hasn't done enough yet or something. He has an appointment next week at least, but it was just like it is driving me so insane.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Do you guys sleep together every night? 00:08:47</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean right now he's also living at my place for the month, so, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I thought he had a separate bedroom?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He does. That bedroom is full of boxes. (both chuckle) He has all this stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. He can't get in there, so that there is not a separate place for him to sleep. I was just thinking to maybe give you space to be able to get a more uninterrupted night. 00:09:14</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I went to back to sleep as soon as he woke me up. I think it's more him not wanting to go to sleep in the first place and if I'm staying up, that's the problem. He can go downstairs and use the Internet while I'm asleep, which he ended up doing later that night, but he wouldn't . . . but like the fact that I stayed up with him for the first part of that . . . 00:09:41</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That really messes with your schedule.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I really don't want him to be upset but I don't know what else to do. Sometimes I have to like convince him that he — because he had been hungry and he was all like, "Oh, I want to go and make this fried chicken and I'm like, "That's going to take too long. It's 2:00 in the morning." He was like, "Oh, well, I shouldn't eat anything." I'm like, "Well you should eat something." We go back and forth. Then I realize we were missing a key ingredient anyways, so he ended up doing something else. All that time having to convince him that yes, he did need to eat something and he was like, "Oh, it's too late," and I'm like, "No, it's too late to . . . (sigh) Just do whatever you want. Just eat something." 00:10:48</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sounds like it can be pretty stressful — to feel so responsible for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I can stop doing anything, but I don't know if that would help either. 00:11:00</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I want him to stop being depressed or to be able to if he's hungry, make enough food and just to live without having to convince him [ ] (inaudible at 00:11:17) and going back and forth and stuff. I want him to be able to help me out sometimes. I want him to figure out a way to get the insomnia fixed because he needs to get more sleep than this. It's messing with my schedule now and I can't really afford that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't make him not depressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. At least in theory I can . . . I mean now at least he realizes how bad it is, I think. He's going to hopefully actually discuss it with his psychiatrist next week, but next Thursday seems like such a far off time. I guess it really doesn't matter that much. Tomorrow there's the [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:16) show we have to go to, so I'm hoping he won't stay up all night long, though he probably will be too tired to do that anyways. I guess it matters less for [ ] (inaudible at 00:12:38) It's still just a really annoying cycle. If I need him to do something for me then he's like . . . I can't understand the fact that sometimes he can't move. He is trying, but it doesn't look like he's trying. It just looks like he's lying there. 00:13:03</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've seen very extreme . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: But is that a thing?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Feeling extremely lethargic is common with depression. It seems like it's pretty extreme for him, really feeling like he can't move at all. You definitely hear a lot of people talk about feeling like it's hard to get motivated, hard to get out of bed; but it sounds the way you describe it, it feels even more intense than that for him. It's really hard to know what somebody else's experience is. 00:13:40</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's always not like he's even tired. It's like, "I feel like I can't move." And I'm just like, "It's a mental block. You can move," because it can happen even if he's well rested. There's no way to predict that it's going to come. And then if we need something, like now I'm feeling depressed if he can't move and he needs a glass of water. I'm like, "I don't want to have to get you a glass of water and carry it all this way with my hand feeling like this. It's just no longer really easy for me to do any of these things. Or like if I need something he can't get it for me because he can't move. He can move - he just thinks he can't move.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does he feel "paralyzed" can't move? 00:48:48</p>

<p>CLIENT: [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:48) paralysis because he can move his hands and stuff when he feels like he can't get up. I guess he's fighting against his body. Part of it I guess is because he feels like it's so overwhelming; and if he does have to do one thing, he does have to do everything and I'm like, "No, you really just have to do this one thing. You just have to make yourself dinner," or "you just have to get yourself a glass of water" or "you just have to go and get me ice."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's unusual to hear someone describe it in that way. I haven't heard someone explain it like that — feeling like they can't move. I've heard people explain it differently, but I don't know if that means he's feeling something different or if it's just the way that he describes it to you. 00:15:44</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't really know either. [ ] (inaudible at 00:15:48) I think want to get out of bed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you describe feeling like you just want to lay in a ball. That's usually how you describe feeling really depressed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I haven't really felt like not having to want to get out of bed since I've been really depressed. I usually can at least get up and shower and all that stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are sort of markers for you. You describe feeling like you just want to lay in a ball and cry vs. times when you feel sad but can go on with your day. 00:16:22</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I can always go on with my day. It hasn't been since college that I haven't just been able to just get on with my day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's been a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was seriously crying too much and I was like, "I don't want to go to class because I can't stop crying." Even then I could still physically get myself food and all that stuff. With Sydney, he can't even do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's really not taking care of himself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And like, at least theoretically, I guess he must have the biggest bladder ever, because he never has to go to the bathroom; because if he had to go to the bathroom, then he would have to drag himself out of bed. He would have to and he would. And then I'd be like, "Okay, you're going to the bathroom, you can get me some ice," or something. If that doesn't happen then he can stay in bed pretty much all day. Is it really hard being like, "Yes, you can get up and take a shower. Yes, you can get up and get dressed." 00:17:38</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are expending a lot of energy working to try to convince him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right now I'm more dependent on him for getting anywhere anyways because I can't just be like, "Okay, fine, if you can't do it I will take your keys and go to wherever I need to go." I guess it depends on where it is and [ ] (inaudible at 00:17:58). Also like if we're going to go out to lunch together I guess, in theory, he doesn't always have to shower and shave but he still needs to get up and get dressed and put on pants and shoes and socks if nothing else. It's still a lot of work to convince him to do even that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Those are things he really used to enjoy doing — going out to eat?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess this week there was one point where he was feeling like he didn't enjoy anything at all and I was just like, "Okay, that's not a good sign." I was like, "What do you want to do? Do you want to watch an episode of Stargate? Do you want to watch one of your videos online? Do you want to play video games?" and he didn't want to do anything. I'm like, "Okay, now we're watching an episode of Stargate," and by the time we were watching the episode, he was fine and was enjoying it. Before that he was so apathetic he didn't want to do anything. I can't really even make him . . . probably like exercising would help all of this and, if it didn't work during the day, would make him tired at night such that he would want to sleep; and it would make him move better and stuff like that. But I can't really go exercising with him right now. I'm all injured and if he feels like he can't move he's not going to want to walk around somewhere. 00:19:35</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It seems like you taking care of you is enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which is really hard enough; so you would think he would be able to take care of me because right now there is no one else who can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there other people who can help take care of him so that you feel less responsible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure who would. He has some close friends, but I'm not sure if he's ever really . . . I mean he calls them when he's really depressed and wants to hurt himself at four in the morning, and they're okay with him calling at four in the morning. Before he was dating me — not now because he has me — but he couldn't ever do that, I think. I don't know if it would calm him or convince him to get out of bed and shower and like that. Yeah, I don't know who else could take care of him besides himself. I think he has to fight this thing for it to happen. When he's depressed he'd have to figure out something eventually. I really want him to do that; I don't want him to keep suffering either.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's a really hard position to be in. 00:20:59</p>

<p>CLIENT: He says that I make him really happy, but I keep on feeling like I say a lot of things that make him sad. Not specifically anything I've done so much, it's just like . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's really sad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If I'm not immediately agreeing with him, it's like, "Yeah," and then he'll be thinking I shot it down or something. Or just over-reacting to everything and then he says something like he doesn't deserve to eat out and I tell him, "No, that's just your depression talking. That doesn't actually make sense."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's pretty dramatic.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Was I like that when I was depressed? I don't know. I really need to know if I was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like some similarities in severity of thoughts. Sometimes your thinking gets pretty extreme when you feel pretty bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Usually mine are more obscure tasks, like I don't ever question the fact that I can shower or get dressed or eat. Even now I can't question whether or not I can do it with my hand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it's not about a question about deservedness. I mean for you right now you have a limited function. It might be more complicated to get dressed, shower, eat because your hand is injured; but it sounds different to say, "I'm not sure I can figure out how to move for this," versus "I don't have the energy" or "I can't move," or "I don't deserve." You are problem solving. 00:22:58</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I might not have the motivation to apply for jobs, but I have the motivation to shower and get dressed and leave the house and eat and all that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm glad to hear that. Those are good markers for you to note. That's where he is and you can see the difference of how you're doing. I wish you were both doing better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess that he's always getting better than he was; but I guess just be really hard for me to see, and I guess he's in a low period right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder how you impact one another.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He says he's always happier with me around and he'd be a lot worse if I wasn't around.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And how do you feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably I'm happier when I'm around him, it's just when he gets depressed it gets really, really stressful. It takes my energy and I keep on feeling that this is really, really unfair and I end up always having to do all the work. Once he gets better it won't be like this, which is why it's tolerable. I just don't know how long it will take for him to get better. He realizes that it's unfair, too. It's really just the depression and not how he would want to be treating me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems very different from when you were first dating.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My depression took like a year to get under control but I got it under control eventually; and with him it's like he's been on different medications and he's still trying to find the right one. I don't know if the current one is the right one. I don't know if the dose he's on is the highest dose he will be on. He's gone up to the full pill but I'm not sure if he's ever going to be taking one-and-a-half pills or two pills or what not. I'm not sure if that's how the drug is supposed to be acting or if it needs a higher dosage to be more effective. 00:25:49</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you said he has an appointment next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He has an appointment next week. I don't know if he'll — it's only a half hour — I don't know if he'll have time to discuss all the things he needs to discuss. He has to discuss how this medication is working. He also has to discuss the insomnia stuff. He's all like, "Oh, well I have some left, like with the anti-anxiety med," and I'm like, "Really, you should." I guess maybe just because I have more drugs, I have all the refills I can; but he has one bottle and maybe he's used half of it or something now - and also because he's so stubborn about taking it, if he's supposed to be taking it to help him get to sleep, too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be helpful to help him make a written list of the things that you feel he should address. One thing that's sometimes affected is memory, and it can sometimes be distracting if the psychiatrist starts to ask questions that are different from what he anticipated, he might forget about the other thing he wanted to bring up. Just having a written list sometimes helps people to stay focused and make sure they do address the points that feel important. 00:27:10</p>

<p>CLIENT: It would probably be good to have him do that or write it down for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a nice way of showing support, too, how to make best use of the appointment you have and appropriately put responsibility for helping to work with those issues on the psychiatrist, rather than putting that responsibility on you. I know you have a really important supportive role; but the more you can get his team to help him, the more you can be his supportive girlfriend and the less you are his caretaker.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's not like I have the ability to change his medications anyways, so I'm limited in what I can do. Unless I go to med school and study to be a psychiatrist, but that would take years and years and I really hope he's not depressed for that long. 00:28:18</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That seems like an inappropriate expectation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's not going to expect me to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I don't think you're expecting you to do that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really. I have no desire, because I would even have to go back to school and take all the pre-med classes, too, for that matter so, yeah, I'll not go to med school. I have no desire to be in med school. It is not my thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think keeping you focused on how you can find a way you can be supportive to him, feel good about yourself and how you are responding to what his needs are, and also making sure that you are getting some support — if not from him, then from other sources — that is where your energy is focused.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just really hard to do that. You know, I see him all the time. I don't see other people all the time. If I wasn't in pain and could get a job and be out of the house more, I'd always have my cell phone with me that he could call me and speak with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think feeling productive would really feel good for you. Right now some of the ways that you usually do that, you can't do; finding a job would feel really good. 0029:46</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really don't want to apply to jobs right now, at least not until I talk to the doctor on Monday. Maybe the doctor will tell me, "You'll have surgery and then you'll be out of commission for six weeks," or something. Granted sometimes it takes forever for places to reply back anyway, so maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could still be looking. If the perfect job popped up, it might be worth applying to that one. You not miss that window if something that's really intriguing to you gets posted. Sometimes it's a while between — and your appointment is on Monday? Hopefully you'll have a lot more information then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just like I don't like sit back and do nothing this week. I can't work on my project that I've been getting paid for. At least it's a contract job and at least the deadline is January.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have time to work on it later.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it's just really frustrating. Also it feels like I want to get all that done before I start another job because I want to finish it. I want to get paid for it and I don't want to leave the work undone and have them need to find someone else for the other half of it. 00:31:19</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's very likely that you're going to be able to go back and finish it by the deadline. There is a lot of time between then and now, and there is a lot of possibility that the doctor will have news that's not the worst-case scenario.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just don't know that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't know that. That's right. So you can't make guesses.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wish this wouldn't have happened until after I had done the project for it to start hurting. That would have been a lot more convenient because then I would have just been sitting around on unemployment again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, this is really inconvenient.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm afraid that we're going to have to pay monstrous amounts of money if I do have to get surgery and the appointment is scheduled for after I lose my health insurance and before I get new health insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand your fear. Hopefully the expiration of your current insurance and when your new insurance starts should be . . .</p>

<p>CLIENT: They're not going to overlap, I don't think. I'm pretty sure that they're going to deny me for August. I'll call them August 15th when it happens and if they put my thing through again they'll probably cover me for September; but I think there will be those two weeks in there where I probably don't have insurance. 00:33:00</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can't apply now with the expectation that your insurance is going to end?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I did. I sent the application in like two weeks ago. I definitely got it in before the deadline. I applied for the August 1st deadline because they said, "Just call us when the situation changes and we'll have everything in the system. That way it will all be processed already." I'm just afraid when I call them there will be a delay on getting the insurance. It won't be like I'll be covered right now. Even if I do call them the day my insurance ends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're doing everything you can to make it as seamless as possible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really annoying that they don't just do it . . . like that they do it . . . (sighs) I guess it's more annoying that my current insurance ends on like — what insurance ends in the middle of the month? It makes no sense. When I was on my old insurance and lost it, I was insured through the end of my birth month, so it ended on February 28th and the new one started on March 1st. There was no gap. But here, there's a gap and I don't know why they do it that way. I can't see any . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't understand it either. Maybe it has something to do with when the semester ends or something? But it still seems completely weird that they wouldn't do like either August 1st or September 1st. They must realize that most of their insurance companies have to do it by month. Then I'm also worried about whether or not my sup will either cover my specialist at General or if they'll want me to see a regular doctor or something, which would be really, really stupid if they didn't have my specialist. It's like they don't want to have to write them a letter. 00:35:16</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll have to see what happens.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I have no clue how good their coverage is or anything like that. I must know people who have been on this insurance. I don't really think I know anyone who was having serious health problems who has been on this insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You will learn the system. I will help you as much as I can if there are things that you need to advocate for.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm really hoping you have to get physical therapy, like that will be covered. Health insurance usually covers physical therapy if you have a referral, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep. Every policy is different but we'll figure out what yours covers and how to advocate for things if they get denied. I can be helpful with that process. 00:36:29</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't even know what it covers because I don't even know what policy I have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, because within it you pick a policy. There are choices.</p>

<p>CLIENT: From what the website was telling me it looked more like there was the one and then the other; and the other is that you choose one of a zillion different health coverage plans, then if you're poor enough you get the first one. I hate their website. It sends you around in circles. I guess in general, for insurance websites it's to their advantage not to give you all the information you need, I guess. I don't think they can deny you for preexisting conditions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think they have that. I don't think preexisting conditions exist in this state.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They don't?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Like internationally they're eventually going to go away, but I don't think it's until 2014.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I deal with a lot of different insurance companies. I'm not 100 percent sure, but I thought that was one of the things that happened here, along with mandating that everybody gets care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What was that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you can't be denied for preexisting conditions. But we'll double-check that because things are constantly changing at the state level and the national level, within one company to the next, so I think that's something that you're probably pretty safe from. But we'll double-check it. 00:38:24</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just waiting for my thing to be processed. They said it was like — I forget if it was 18 days or 18 business days or what they gave for the processing. They gave some rough estimate that seemed like a large amount of time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really hard not to know — not to feel secure. There's a lot that you have to deal with sitting with uncertainty right now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know if my hand didn't hurt so bad I'd be tempted to just not to go to the doctor at all.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you need to see somebody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I need to see somebody.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And right now you have coverage.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right now I have coverage.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So we can see. And you need to be seen. You need to find out what's going on and what you can do. Why don't we wrap up there for today? I know we're going to meet on Tuesday since you have the hand doctor on Monday, and I think that's at . . . I'll double-check it to make sure. At 2:30 I have you down? 00:39:47</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Maybe I just didn't put it in my calendar because I got the e-mail from you. Yeah, that sounds right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then I don't think we scheduled for August. We can put a bunch in. Would you like to schedule some for August?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the first half of August.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I have us for Tuesday at 2:30 and then Friday the 27th, at 2:30 as well, and then your normal Monday the 30th, at 1:30. We can continue to do Mondays the 6th, the 13th and the 20th at 1:30.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I'm hesitant about scheduling the 20th, because that's after the coverage but . . .</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you won't probably have an answer from them, so I don't know if you want to meet and keep your fingers crossed or take a break for a little bit. We can also check in and see how you're doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that might work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why don't I hold your space for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We'll see how you're doing at that point and make some decisions then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is it true that sometimes they'll cover things retroactively?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I have had that experience in the past where even they don't - say you don't know when your start date is, I've had experience where it was retroactive to some date when you applied or some date when something else happened, so I don't know which insurance does that and which doesn't, but I've definitely had that experience with people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How much will the sessions be if I have to end up paying out of pocket?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My full fee is $165. We can negotiate a sliding-scale fee since you're not employed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I mean I guess at least some of it is paid for — like my co-pay is paid for. I don't know how much you're actually getting paid for any of the sessions.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can incorporate that into your sliding-scale fee and make that reasonability for you. Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I will see you on Tuesday.</p>

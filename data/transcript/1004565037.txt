<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how have you guys been doing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good. It's crazy. He turned six weeks old yesterday, which I can't believe. I feel like it's going by so quickly. It's just been a blur. But he started smiling too, which has been awesome. We were reading around six weeks old is when you might start to see the real social smile. So that's been really fun too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's nice that it's been getting a little more interactive too, getting some positive feedback.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's crazy to see how much has changed. So that's been really fun. And we've been seeing my family a ton and Todd's family, and it's been nice that everyone is so in love with him and wants to see him, which has been hard. (laughter)</p>

<p>[00:58.8]</p>

<p>We are getting better about balancing things too because now that Todd is back to work, it's hard. We feel like the weekends are our time to have with our little family too. And Todd especially, he's like "I don't want people to come over and hold him because that's my time to hold him."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like he doesn't get any time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So we've been good about kind of strategizing about seeing people during the week and stuff like that so we can have our time on the weekend together. So that's been working out well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad to hear that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I feel like the only thing that has still been hard is breastfeeding. It's so funny, after I talked with you last — I think I was here kind of a while ago. I think it was more than two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it was more like three weeks. I saw you at the beginning of a week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now it's the end. Yeah. And things have been going really well. Then I got a plugged duct.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was so painful, and I didn't really know what it was because it had never happened before. So I felt like I had this good stretch and then that hit. So that was something else to try and figure out.</p>

<p>[02:01.3]</p>

<p>I have a lot of friends who have breastfed their babies, so it was good to talk to them. Then there's that breast feeding support group that I had been going to — still go to — so I was able to talk to a woman there. So I was able to get help for it, but it was hard because it was one more thing that wasn't going right. And then thankfully that went away in a few days, so that was good.</p>

<p>And then I feel like we've had this really really good stretch of it going really well, and then just in the past couple of days again he's been kind of funny eating. And then today I woke up and I think I have another plugged duct. But it's not quite as bad at the first one. So I feel that's been the hardest part, wanting that consistency of knowing it's going well. I feel like every time I think maybe now we're in the groove, something pops up to make it hard again.</p>

<p>[03:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's especially difficult when it's something that causes you pain, because it just makes your tolerance less for everything else. You can't not feed him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. I know. And thankfully —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Although you can feed him in other ways.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we are going to try a bottle, to introduce a bottle this weekend while we have some downtime, because we haven't done that at all yet. So I think that will help too in terms of, I love being able to spend so much time with him, but it is nice to know I can have more than three hours away from him if I need to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just gives you a little more flexibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that will be nice for Todd too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, to be able to feed him and be involved.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so we'll try that and see how it goes. But I'm just craving that get into a routine, like have it feeling like it's going well with the breastfeeding. I'm not so sure I'll get that. All my friends are like "The pattern is, there is no pattern, so get used to it." (laughter) So, I think — that's just hard for me and I think I will get used to it.</p>

<p>[04:03.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you do really well with a lot of consistency.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. But even the past couple of days has been a little tricky with him eating. Todd was funny, he's like "You're handling this much better than you did two weeks ago when he wasn't eating well."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So being able to step back and notice that it is a little bit less — it throws you a little bit less each time the pattern gets changed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. And this morning especially, I woke up and I was just like upset about thinking about it was another plugged duct, and Todd sort of picked up on that too. He's like "I really don't have to be at work until 11, so why don't you take a shower, just take your time this morning" and he went in later. So that really helped too. I was like "You pulled me from the edge of having a bad morning. Thank you." (laughter) So that was good to know that I think we're kind of able to figure out each other's points of being frustrated and helping each other out with that too, which has felt good.</p>

<p>[05:02.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there a connection — you had said he was having a little bit of trouble eating the last couple of days, and now you think you might have another plugged duct. Is there a connection if he's not eating as much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. And thankfully — I think before, I think what threw me off the most with the plugged duct was worrying about him not eating enough. And since then, we've had his one-month appointment and he's gained tons of weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe he actually needs a little bit less.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it could be.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe if he's going through a growth spurt and (inaudible at 05:31.9) changes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just changes. So I feel like that — I just keep reminding myself that with it now, it's okay because it's just painful for me and it's nice not to have that worry that he's not eating enough. Like I feel like that has been a huge relief to know that he's gained more than they even expected him to. So that just felt good to have that kind of — because that was definitely in the back of — but the front of my mind, when he was doing funny things with eating, so it's nice to have that security of — even if he's not eating a lot, he's got it down, so it's okay.</p>

<p>[06:06.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you might, if you notice he's not eating as much, you might pump a little bit just to relieve yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I figured that part out too now, because I realized that the last time. Because I wasn't really pumping, worried that would make my supply more and make it worse. But I think that's —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you can just do a little, and you don't have to pump to empty your breast. You can just pump a little bit to, you know, keep things flowing, and it's probably not stimulating that much more production. But it's tricky to figure out the balance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not supposed to have it down yet, because this is the first time you've done everything.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, and it's like a weird feeling. I was saying to Todd that it's weird that something you would do eight times a day — and it takes us awhile, probably like 45 minutes or an hour, between burping and changing — that you can do something that many times a day, and now he's six weeks old, and it's still hard to get the hang of. But it's nice to know that other people experience the same thing.</p>

<p>[07:09.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, six weeks isn't that much time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and that's what Todd keeps saying. He's like "You need to give both of you credit. He's still trying to figure it out. You're still trying to figure it out."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're right, and it's something you obviously spend a lot of your time doing now. But if you step back, you've been a mom for six weeks. You've been breastfeeding for six weeks. That's a pretty short amount of time to have practiced something. And he's changed quite a bit, even in just the first six weeks. From newborn to now, he's probably doing things differently.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. And it is good to know. I think he's becoming more consistent — efficient, I guess — with his eating. So I think that's a worry that I had, that he's not eating for as long. I talked to his pediatrician, and she's like "That kind of makes sense. He's getting the hang of it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He's probably got a much stronger [esophagus].</p>

<p>[08:00.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I think it's learning how to be better and go with the flow. Now that I know he's gaining weight, that's helping me to do that a little bit more. I feel like there's always something that gets thrown in, just when I think that things are sort of evening out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You don't want to get too comfortable, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. He just wants to keep me on my toes. (chuckles) I guess that's good. But it's also been nice. I feel like the past couple of weeks, especially last week with the weather being so nice, we got out every day. I was taking him out in the stroller and things like that. So it's nice to have that independence again too, of being able to get out. And I've totally noticed a difference with the rain this week. It's hard to bring him out.</p>

<p>So there was one day I was with him for pretty much — Todd got home pretty late, and when he got home I was like "We have to do something, do something fun. At least cook a fun dinner or something, because I need some kind of outlet after being home all day." So that's kind of — I think that's good to be aware of too, that I was good about planning to do something every day when the weather was nice. Then when this weather has hit, I didn't have as many plans set up.</p>

<p>[09:12.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might be useful to think about looking ahead, coming up with some plans that you don't necessarily need to stick to, but having options set up for days or weeks like that when it's going to be rainy. Kind of trying to think "What will I do if?" Looking ahead at the forecast, you've got a couple of rainy days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know, yeah. (chuckles) Yeah, so I think that was good because we got spoiled with such good weather for —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes it a lot easier to get out when you've got good weather.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and now that I'm feeling physically better too — I actually went to class, my last classes for each one of those.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. I know you were kind of hoping you could check in and see people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that went really well. My mom had her April vacation two weeks ago, so she actually came down a bunch of days and helped me with Trae. So I left him at home, which is the first time I left him, and went in a couple of days. And then there were a couple of days she wasn't able to do when she went back to work this week — I guess it was Monday when I brought him in. But it was just nice to know that I can get somewhere on my own, get back on my own.</p>

<p>[10:21.1]</p>

<p>I had to give a presentation on Monday, and we were able to do that. My professor just held him because he got a little antsy before it was my turn. So it was nice to know that I could like do all of that on my own. Todd had been so helpful in those beginning weeks, driving me to the breastfeeding group or whatever. Now it's nice to know we can get out on our own.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds like you feel much more proficient at navigating what you need to navigate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the stroller is still daunting on the bus. That's the only thing. I just love to be able to walk, so we walked most days to school. I think it's just because it's big, it's hard, especially when it's crowded. But other than that, I think it's been good. Although I haven't driven with him yet. That's my next big thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just going to ask you that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't drive all the time anyway, just because with school I would either walk or take the bus mostly, and Todd usually has the car during the week. That's how he usually goes to school. So I just like — even before Trae was born, I didn't drive that often. On the weekends when we were going somewhere, Todd was usually driving.</p>

<p>[11:28.3]</p>

<p>So I've gone long stretches without driving anyway, but now I haven't since he's been born. It hasn't been anything — because I told myself I was not going to let that stop me from doing something. So if something comes up, I'm not going to say no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel about driving?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In general, I'm definitely a more anxious driver which probably fits with my personality. (chuckles) But I don't enjoy driving. Even before he was born, it was something that — sometimes I would be uncomfortable driving, but I made myself do it because I would never want that to stand in the way of me doing something, you know. So I feel like I've never been a totally comfortable driver, but I wouldn't let it stand in my way. And then I feel like just because we live in a city, I don't really have to drive all the time anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can sort of very easily get around without having to do it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but sometimes I feel like that's a crutch too because it doesn't force me to do it all of the time. So I feel like that's the next thing. There hasn't been something where I've been invited to do something or wanted to make a plan and I said no because I'd have to drive there. But I just feel like there should be something coming up to force me to do it.</p>

<p>[12:37.2]</p>

<p>Because I do think that's probably the last thing in terms of feeling really independent with him again. So we'll see. I'm trying to make a plan to see the teacher who I've been working with. We're trying to finish up our project, so I'm supposed to see her next week. So I think that will be the day. So I think it will be good to know, it's something that's important to me, and I want to do it, and I'm not going to say no. We'll try it out and see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it feel different to drive with him versus on your own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, definitely. Even when I was pregnant with him, I noticed a difference. Just like being more aware and just thinking, oh my gosh, if anything ever happened, and worrying about that. And I feel like I don't let it overtake me. It's in the back of my mind. I would be nervous about driving, but I would be good about not letting it prevent me from doing something.</p>

<p>[13:37.1]</p>

<p>Now I feel that he'll be in the back seat and that will make me feel even more nervous about driving and the people around me driving, and things like that. So I think that will be my next challenge to overcome. (chuckles) And I know that Todd is such a comfortable driver, and even the first couple of times we were driving with Trae, even he was nervous. I think part of it is kind of natural, but I think that my inclination before he was even born that I wasn't a huge fan of driving makes it worse.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. That's not necessarily going to change much, certainly in the direction of making you feel more comfortable. So what can you say to sort of talk yourself down, because you're going to be a better driver if you're not really anxious. So trying to find ways to concentrate on what's in your control and what you're supposed to be paying attention to in order to be safe.</p>

<p>[14:33.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I was thinking about it too, because we've talked a lot about trusting myself and that's something I need to be better about. And I feel that's a perfect example, like my hesitation to drive is a perfect example of not trusting myself enough. And I think I'll just need to know that I am a good driver and I can drive, that I've been driving for a long time before he was born, and to just get back and do it.</p>

<p>But I was also saying to Todd your suggestion to practice with him when Todd was around, getting the stroller out, getting the car seat in, stuff like that, really helped just to make me feel more comfortable. So I was saying to him "Maybe we should do the first couple of drives with you in the passenger seat, then I'll feel a little bit better that way."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. You may just want to take a practice drive and have you be responsible for putting him in the car seat and make sure the car seat is attached properly so you feel comfortable. And have Todd be the passenger and you drive and [if he cries] in the back seat, figure out how you block that out and keep driving or do you pull over if it's safe to do that.</p>

<p>[15:50.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because I do feel that will be — especially in the summertime if I want to go up to my parents' and see them while Todd is working, or my friend Stephanie, she's been driving up here to visit us. We haven't seen each other in a couple of weeks, but she had a couple of weeks in a row where she came up when he was really little. So now I feel I owe it to her to make a trip down there since she's been good about coming up here. So I think it will just be really nice to feel more confident with that. So we'll see. That will be the next thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it would be hard because it's one of those situations when you're in control of some things but not of others, and keeping a clear line for yourself of what you can really control and what you can't control and letting go of that. Obviously you have no control over other drivers. You have control over what you do. But you also lose a lot of control over him because he's in the backseat and if he cries, you can't pick him up.</p>

<p>[16:54.3]</p>

<p>It can be hard, but I think it's important to remind yourself that if he's crying, he's okay. Alright? And eventually he'll stop. There might be some places if you're driving around locally where you can pull over and give him a paci or a [diaper] check or whatever. But if you're on the highway driving up to a friend's house, you might have to just let him cry for a little bit. Not that it has to be comfortable, but he's okay and concentrating on driving is the safe thing to do, not concentrating on trying to soothe him. That's hard. A lot of people feel very split in situations like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I can see that that will be hard to just make sure that you're concentrating on what you need to be concentrating on. And even, you were saying, we want to try getting one of those little mirror things that you can put — because you can't even see him in the back. Because I was riding in the back seat in the first couple of weeks and now I've transitioned to the front seat with Todd, so that's one first step.</p>

<p>[17:54.1]</p>

<p>But even Todd was saying that it would be nice to be able to see him to just him to make sure his neck isn't flopped over or something. We'll see if we can find a little mirror or something to do that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you need to test yourself and see is that more of a distraction. Check it out and see, am I being distracted by that or do I actually look and feel soothed? Because I think some people have different reactions. Sometimes they have that and they're very tempted to keep checking back, keep checking back, and then you're not looking at the road.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is important. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But for other people, they find they can take one quick look, they feel soothed. So you kind of just need to check in with yourself and see how do things like that work for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that will be good to see how that goes, because I can see me going both ways. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's really a matter of finding out what it's like for you, and being honest about which is best for you.</p>

<p>[18:57.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I was also thinking to just start out with the first drive with him alone, doing a drive I know really well, like picking up Todd at school or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. Do something that's not too long and that you're comfortable with. Sure. That makes sense.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, we'll see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does he usually do in the car?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty good. Usually if he's fussy when we first put him in, once we get going he usually does fall asleep. So I think that will help us too. There's been a couple of times where he's had some trouble, but for the most part he's been okay. But he really hasn't been in the car that much anyway, which is so funny. It's a totally different lifestyle where both Todd and I grew up in such rural areas. It's fun to know he'll be more of a little city boy.</p>

<p>[19:44.7]</p>

<p>So I feel like that was the biggest thing to think about going forward. I feel like what I was sharing with you before about worrying about things that might happen that haven't happened, instead of just being glad [they're happening]. Like with my sleeping and stuff. I feel like that has still been fine, and I'm so glad. There was one night — usually I will go to bed and fall asleep immediately because I'm so tired. There was one night where I was having trouble feeding him and he was really fussy. Todd got up to help me, so both of us were up and trying to get him back to sleep. That was the first night I had that was — it probably took me 15 minutes to fall asleep instead of instantly.</p>

<p>But even with just that one night, I was like oh no, I hope this doesn't mean this is going to start happening. I feel like so far I've been so thankful that I really — like, not sleeping well was consuming me before he was born. You know, I was thinking about it so much that once it was under control, I was feeling good. Then I'd have a bad night and it was just like, I'd be so glad when it was going well and I haven't really thought much about it since he's been born. But it has been in the back of my mind like, I hope that doesn't start up again. So things like that, where I'm starting to think that things are going well so I don't need to think about it, but it's still definitely in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>[21:09.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so when those "I hope" type statements come into your head, what do you want to do with them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just remind myself that it has been going so well. Now it's been six weeks of it okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Focusing on what is actually happening, rather than letting your mind jump into "What ifs." Because I think "I hope" is really a "What if" flipped.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. (chuckles) Definitely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And those "What if" statements are jumping into the future, and you don't have any control over those. So bringing your head back to "This is what is actually happening in the moment. Right now we're doing fine." Letting yourself be comfortable with what is happening can help pull you back from the worries that usually happen in the future. You're usually not that worried in the present.</p>

<p>[22:01.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think will be good because it's been the sleeping and then the — it's been so funny because it's been so nice not having to worry about checking my door or whatever. When I was telling you the last time too, I feel like it's nice to have that gone but that's another thing in the back of my head. Thinking like am I going to think up something else, that that will be my thing I'll need to check. Or if there's something on him that I'll need to keeping checking.</p>

<p>He's been sleeping in our room, and Todd has kind of been pushing to get him into his own room which is literally — the wall separates us. We have a tiny little apartment, so it's probably like he's basically right with us. There's one wall that will separate us once he goes into his crib. But I feel like that might be hard to transition him into the other room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think will be difficult about it for you?</p>

<p>[22:54.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think just because when I do wake up, he's right next to our bed in a little cradle. So it's nice just to be able to peek at him and know that he's okay. But Todd has been joking because he hears every little noise that Trae makes, and I think that has helped me a lot to be able to sleep because I know that Todd can hear it. (chuckles) He goes "You have it easy if you're relying on me to wake up."</p>

<p>But that has been so nice for me because usually I can sleep very soundly, and I always wondered what it would be like when I had a baby. I definitely hear him, but like the little noises and stuff I can kind of tune out and just sleep. But it's kind of because I know Todd is listening. (chuckles) But that's been hard for Todd, because he is hearing him, so that's why he's been saying "You know, we can move him into his own room." The sooner the better, just in terms of his sleep.</p>

<p>[23:49.8]</p>

<p>But it is nice just to be able to peer over and know that he's all set, and then I can just roll over and go to sleep again. So we'll see. We never did get a baby monitor because our apartment is so small that we joked that we didn't need one. But I was wondering if we did move him into his room, if that would make me feel better to have one. But then Todd is like "Doesn't that defeat the point?" (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He'll still hear every noise.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. But then I was thinking just for like if we're taking a nap during the day, usually we're in the same room. But I was thinking it would definitely make me uncomfortable to have him in a different room if Todd weren't home because I'd really be worried that I wouldn't hear. So I think having that as a back-up for when Todd is not around or something like that, that might help.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it gives you the flexibility of trying it out different ways.</p>

<p>[24:41.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And we have friends that have the video monitor, and I'm not sure how we feel about that because that could be like the mirror in the car. It could be a nice quick check for me to know he's fine to look at the video monitor, but I don't always want to be checking it. Todd has mixed feelings about it for himself too. He's wondering if that would make us too focused on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like you're not being kept up at night by worries about what his sleep is like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it doesn't seem like a monitor is going to create new worries for you. Regarding the noises and will that keep Todd awake and defeat the purpose of moving the baby a little bit farther away potentially, you can change the volume up and down. If you want to get a video monitor, I don't think it's going to create worries for you. If it does, you can turn it off. This is not a permanent lifetime decision.</p>

<p>[25:53.1]</p>

<p>I think people have survived for centuries without them. So I don't think it's necessary, but I also don't think it's going to hurt you. Again, it's like testing it out and seeing and being honest with yourself about how this is impacting us. If it's helping you, you can keep it. If it's hurting you, you can get rid of it. I guess you have to also figure out if financially it makes sense for you guys, but it's not a huge item.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thankfully we have tons of money towards Babies R Us. (laughter) We have lots of gift cards, so at least it's not a financial thing we have to deal with. But yeah, I think that's true. We could try it out if we wanted to. It's not a permanent thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You just need to be honest with yourself about how is this affecting us. Is this helping me to get more sleep? Is it helping me be more comfortable? Or is this one of those things that's helping me feel better in the moment, but actually creating more of an anxiety or worry? Because it sounds like sleep is going pretty well, and you don't want to make it more complicated for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've been lucky that we're definitely up a lot to feed him, but in between he's been pretty good about sleeping. Once in a while he'll have nights where it's hard getting him back to sleep, but for the most part, he's been giving us little stretches in between, so that's good. We got almost three-and-a-half hours out of him the other night. We saw the clock when we woke up, and I was like "Oh my gosh, that was so long." (laughter) We were telling some friend who doesn't have a baby and they were like "You were happy that you got three-and-a-half consecutive hours of sleep?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not something I think you can understand until you've been there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. It was pretty funny.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm happy for you that that felt good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, it did feel good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm far enough away from it that that sounds miserable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) Yeah, someday we'll be away from it too. We'll look back on it and think "Wow, we were happy about that?"</p>

<p>[27:52.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's funny how quickly you get used to getting more sleep again. For some reason, for the past month my little one has been getting up once at 4:00 and — this sounds great, I'm sure, to you, getting up one time a night. But I'm so tired, and I used to get up every two hours. You will adjust back the other direction as he gets older and think that three-and-a-half hours of sleep is just not enough. But I'm glad he's doing what he's supposed to be doing, and you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. Getting those stretches a little bit longer, a little bit at a time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it will be fun to see how — because we were reading how, and my friend was saying too, once her baby hit around ten or 12 weeks, that he was able to go pretty long stretches. We'll see if that's going to be the case. We won't hold our breath.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course, there's lots of differences between babies, and they take steps forward and back.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what we're learning. It's not one set path, and you're just going to have lots of surprises along the way.</p>

<p>[29:01.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. It's helpful to have — you have a great network of people to be able to get ideas and stories of what other people have been through. You can start to imagine what things will be like when he gets older. But remember there is so much room for individual difference, and it's healthy. If it's different from your friends' patterns, that doesn't mean that something is wrong. There's general trends, at least.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and as educators I think we just have to remind ourselves that to bridge that with what we know about our own baby with what we know about education. There are lots of variabilities.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly. If you keep that perspective, you will get a lot out of the experience. Well, we should probably stop for today. We didn't get time to do a breathing exercise. I don't know how it would go anyway.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. It might have been hard anyway. (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: With another being attached to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, do you want to schedule for next time?</p>

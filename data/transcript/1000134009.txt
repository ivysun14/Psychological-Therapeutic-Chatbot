<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Session 12, client RC (ph), October 19th?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something like that; 19, 19? Is this machine going? (bangs on mic)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Eighteenth ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eighteenth?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (banging on mic) Is this machine actually recording? Yes, I'm tapping it and it's doing (inaudible at 0:00:21.1). One thing I need ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mind if I do that? [It's really warm out.] (ph)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's fine. One thing I need to find out from you: is there a place that I can get a hold of you during the day if I ever have to cancel or anything like that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. I hope I didn't screw you up, by the way, last week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. You screwed me up this because I couldn't get a hold of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you wanted to cancel this week?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wanted to cancel tonight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it's not your problem. What is an — I have two business phone numbers for you ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:00:47.6) my card.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... neither of which work. Central 6 — which is CE6-4804. Boy, that bothers me. Well, I was calling 6804 and I got a very snappy lady. "No!"</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, people [aren't always polite] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Republic Realty Mortgage Corporation. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Damn straight, sister. You're collecting — (inaudible at 0:01:17.5)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I had a meeting where I supposed to be at 7:30 (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I canceled to tell them I wasn't coming because I couldn't get a hold of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'm really sorry that happened to you. I had to cancel last week because (inaudible at 0:01:38.3). I called (inaudible) I didn't have any confidence in them at all, so I called (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thank you. They didn't cooperate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: They didn't? Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I never heard from them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK. Well, I'm glad I got a hold of him. Did he get a hold — did he call you (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. He called after I'd been sitting here waiting for about ten minutes and one of the other staff members was here that I hadn't seen for a while, so it was all fine. Although I'm glad that you called and now I find that, OK, I am missing phone calls; they're supposed to call me at home.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Yes, right. Lucky I had your number because it would have been — I know it's frustrating.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And I'd like to talk to you, if you've got a few minutes afterwards, about some ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) class?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Real estate.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Then I could start charging you. I expect to get a cut on my feet for any of our discussions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Professional discussions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Five minute's worth? Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Time is money.</p>

<p>Ah, well, my life is a complete wreck.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You feel like a complete wreck?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I was traveling all over the countryside; tasting the dust of the countryside out in (inaudible) looking at (inaudible) that I had to finance. (chuckles) [That's a bitter experience] (ph), but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was a bitter experience?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it was a little bit interesting. I mean especially, seriously, just in a way of normal frustration doing business. I'm involved with some people now that are just incredible, bad news, and it's a real opportunity for a fee but every time I call them up they sound immensely uncomfortable. Well, I don't want to go through all that but I just [went up on the report] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's an uncomfortable-making situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it really is. The trouble with them is that they just will not take my — I get this feeling, anyway — they won't take me seriously; they want to dabble with me a little bit. And if it weren't me but if it were somebody else in the office talking to them, I'd get a better reaction; at least a little bit more of a serious reaction. But be that as it may, that's — I don't think there's too much in group to talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's not what you want to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I was talked around and about and through and under and so on and so forth. You recall last time I was telling you about this — that we had a little exercise concerning this girl I was taking out and I (clears throat) I don't really know what exactly I want to say about it except that I went out with her over the weekend again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This last weekend.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes. And the Sunday before that, too. And in fact, she had told me, at some point in time, that she was going to make a dinner Sunday and I forgot about it and had to cancel out on the dinner because I had a business appointment on that Sunday. And I did arrive, finally, later on. We had a nice time. But I think I'm making some little bit of progress with her in some respects because she seems — we seem to be talking a little bit more on the same wavelength, in a way; and I think that my prior suspicions — well, not suspicions but my prior feelings about her were probably correct; you know, (inaudible at 0:05:07.5) maybe that's she a little bit of a walking wounded creature herself in some way. And through some tentative, you know, vibrations going on there (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So not only you are tentative but she's tentative, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes, yes. I think that she's looking out a little bit, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what does that do to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yes, that makes me feel kind of good in a way. I just hope that I can maintain a good equilibrium in this thing; in the relationship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Equilibrium of what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, so it goes along on a kind of directed pattern that I want it to go along in, you know? It's not becoming an immense — hmm?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) Along the straight and narrow? Along the straight and narrow?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. (chuckles) Guess I don't have much choice in the matter. Along the straight and narrow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean you don't have much choice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I mean I'm not about to seduce her. You know. And so I hope that I can maintain that program in that sense. But it was funny. As I say, I don't know exactly what I can say because I haven't thought about it at all — you know, what my feelings are — except I feel a little bit more positive about it than I did then.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And accept that — you know, [accept that it and maybe because of it certainly, too] (ph), I've seen her — she said something that was funny to me. We were out Saturday night and we went to a wedding that she invited me to. It was really a goofy wedding. She didn't know anybody at the thing and she was going for I don't know what reason. But we went over to — after this — it was an evening wedding; a Saturday night — after this, we went over to a saloon to get a drink and I was going to make a phone call to check on a party that we were going to go to. I did that. While we were standing there, we saw some guy that she'd currently gone out with once or twice before. Right? He's a very familiar (inaudible at 0:06:57.0) which annoys the hell out of me and kind of (inaudible). And she is a little bit that way. She plays herself that way; kind of raucous; drink and all pretty good and kind of got a pretty tough laugh sometimes (inaudible) a little bit.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That really irritates you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes. Because that's not my bag, you know. And so I was going crazy communicating this dislike of this whole thing to her because I don't know if you remember exactly what I said. But I'd done this before, too, at another party we'd gone to and she had become aggressive and that's that other party where she was — I thought I was going to have to leave, you know.</p>

<p>And so she finally broke down and she said — and it was very funny the way she said it — she kept saying, "Well, you don't like my friends," or something like that, "and you're always uncomfortable around them," and so on and so forth. And I am. I become very stuffed shirt about it, you know, at that point and look at them over my nose at whoever is carrying on; if I can get away with that attitude, I'll do that. And she said, you know, "You're always uncomfortable with these people. I like these people. I think that" — she said, "I think that you don't have to play the role so much," and all of this and kept going on. And I just — suddenly her voice kind of changed. She said, "I don't mind when people deal with me like that because I think they like me as a person."</p>

<p>And she was using all this [can't type] (ph) of language that I didn't feel that she could believe them and I certainly didn't believe them; telling that to her. And then she finally said, "Well, I think that's the way people should act towards one another if they like each other as people," and then she just sort of (inaudible at 0:08:35.6). She said, "But I hate it." And she just let that go and come out and just went on to something else. You know? And I didn't follow up on it at that point because I didn't want to pursue it too aggressively at that point.</p>

<p>So, we had a very nice time, I think, Saturday night. And she is that way, though, because we went to this party with my friends ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She is — what do you want to be talking about, right now, in terms of ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want to be trying to figure out what way I feel about her at this point, I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Well, how did you — I went out to lunch for about a two-minute segment and I'm lost. I heard your words but I didn't hear what they were; about the bit about "and I hate them."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes. See, what I'm trying to say is that I appear to be having some influence on her and that's one of the things ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she's being more honest and telling you how she really does feel and that makes you feel pretty great.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) Yes, right. Yes, yes. Because at least we're dealing in the kind of terms that are promising, certainly. You were about to interject something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was and then I [was somewhere what happened after that] (ph). Well, first, it seems — when I said, "That's pretty great," and you said, "Yes," and I felt like you were just jumping off the great thing and back into the ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it's pretty great. It makes ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... [junky part or] (ph) ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It's just promising, you know? It isn't so terrific. It's promising. At least it's something ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, well are you enjoying the promising?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, but with great ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fear and trepidation ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, right, right. You know, don't count the chickens and all that big, you know ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not enjoying it. You're shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) That might be, that might be. I really don't want to, you know — I was thinking that — matter of fact, the one time I did enjoy it was Sunday before I finally got home and I really, really did get a kick out of it. You know? But I immediately thought — not immediately but I thought to myself, "Well, relax and cool it," because I think I do sometimes have a tendency to go way overboard on it and go about — have days that the smallest kind of light in the tunnel (inaudible at 0:11:05.2). And so I don't want to do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's pretty neat to be able to enjoy the promising one, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes. So it was one of the more pleasant emotions that I experienced in a long time. At the same time, in the background — hovering over all this — is the (inaudible at 0:11:28.0) will have to work itself out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's plenty of time. (inaudible) this one little thing (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, we had a large (inaudible at 0:11:40.0) and that's - and I think — you know, I think one of the interesting things — I don't know whether it's good or bad and I think I just mentioned this before — about these things or talking the way I do with you is that it enables me, as I suppose you intend it to do, to really recognize some of the things that I'm thinking about and especially and continuingly, in terms of a certain resentment that [I hit and not any longer] (ph) so much stifling that feeling in myself and thinking, "Well, I should think this, I should think that." You know, that's wrong.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is a very valid kind of thing that happened and I'm uncomfortable with it still. But I just get the feeling that it's better just to feel that way about it than it is not to recognize it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) I think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's one of the other promising things that I think could happen because seems to me that if I can transfer — and think I'm doing it with some of this —</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's a really positive thing (inaudible at 0:12:42.5)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That fact that I can, you know — what's a fancy word — externalize the resentment and that — just keep it all [about a level] (ph). In other words, if I can take — and this might be a little bit wrong; it might be a little bit perverse — but if I can take some of the resentment that I had been throwing at myself and throw it at somebody else, really, so that I'm not completely to blame for everything that goes wrong ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not completely sucked under with it but have a little bit of you free to do something else with your time and energy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) Yes, right. That is — right, right, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is pretty neat.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I really do hope that works. As I say, I haven't completely ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Again, it's very tentative promise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because it goes against, you know, all the (chuckles) prior years. But ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's the laugh about? "It goes against all the (chuckles) prior years."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, all the prior years of doing — being involved in self-defeating things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. I was just aware of some of the emotion that slipped in there with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just thinking what that was.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Distaste, I think.</p>

<p>(loud rumbling sound)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In the prior years?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes. Because you know, really, I had come to — part of the resentment is — and I feel that's why I look at other people sometimes — you know, I just don't understand why they have a license to be happy and have reasonably satisfying lives — [at least a purpose] (ph) — and I am foreclosed out of it. And that's the kind of thing that can make me awfully, awfully, you know, goddamn mad, you know? And especially going to this wedding and the girl was positively (inaudible at 0:14:36.0) and she was, she was gorgeous, she looked terrific. And the guy looked — he was a jerk, you know, but I suppose he was happy.</p>

<p>But I thought, "Why is this lout who ..." — and I was a bit of a snob about it — who was working in the basement of Montgomery Ward's able to marry this pretty girl and give her all this happiness, make her happy and I'm bumbling about and supposedly a titan of high finance and all that and (inaudible at 0:15:08.7)? You know? And I've begun to now, at this point, rather than saying, "Look, I am alone, I am a schlep, you know, and shrinking into the [sea all further] (ph)," I'm beginning to think that — you know, that this was caused as much by others as by myself. It's very difficult — it's still very difficult for me to believe. You know, I just ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What you're saying is you still — it seems like it's not all you that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I want it to be that. Right. I want it to be that. But I think it is becoming that, so then I'm thinking that it isn't all me and it was others and I have to look out for myself in many ways; vis-�-vis my brothers, my sisters and my parents and so on and so forth and not immediately assume that I am in some way mistaken. You know? And so I think that's a positive thing. [0:16:09.3]</p>

<p>And one of the things that brought it out, as I say, was going to that wedding and seeing it and feeling that resentment towards someone else (inaudible). Why can't I do it, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And feeling a lot more like it is possible for you to marry that kind of girl and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and it's kind of happening and I hope it happens fairly soon because (inaudible at 0:16:36.2) mortality and all that, you know. Feel like I'm getting older and — I really do. The signs (inaudible) sort of settling in, you know; I'm 28 now and pretty soon you're 32.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're aware of all the 28-year-old guys out there in the world. My husband is 28; discovered his first gray hair yesterday. He had a conniption fit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, it's very unpleasant. And to me it's sort of — it's not a big, dramatic thing; it's a sort of annoying thing — at this point, anyway. But I think about it, you know. Because you could just go on, day by day, living it in one degree of misery or another and hopefully it's tolerable; somewhere it remains tolerable. And then you get up and you're 45, you know? [That's pretty much it] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, you want to get out of the day-by-day. You've got to start making some plans; otherwise, you will be 42 without anything to show for it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Find a] (ph) better day like today or something, you know. And so just want to be more ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And for you, that very much includes finding a woman. [0:17:41.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right, sure it does, sure it does. And I think that — (inaudible) whatever being the answer in terms of getting married to her or something of that kind but I think and I hope, you know, that I can establish in her mind the right frame of reference that we're going to be on. You know? And that would involve some of the things we talked about. You know, then you said, "What would you tell her and what do you want to do?" So (inaudible) I think that that's possible; it might be established because — the reason why that's possible is because she's a little bit crippled herself in her dealings with people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't like your saying that that's the reason. Another side of the reason might be that you're dealing straight with her and you have something to offer and you're somewhat of an appealing person.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:18:32.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That might be working for that reason.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, correct.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And not you're coming on like a cripple and, you know, going through the snob routine to hide it or — you know, the different things that you've done to distance. But of your dealing straight and your [general appeal] (ph) (inaudible at 0:19:02.0). What are you feeling right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I'm thinking you're right. I hope you're not — you know, because I was, in large measure, justifying the whole thing and the fact that I was going to help her in some way and that — you know, as though we're both tumbling or stumping through life or something; that's not especially attractive and if she becomes aware of that (inaudible at 0:19:26.2). Nevertheless, it's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is true to you right now; in other words, that's the way you feel about it right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not that it's necessarily the objective reality (inaudible at 0:19:40.4) that's what you feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, that's what I feel. And I feel that way because I've seen her in action. And I feel that way because of what she says about hating her relationships she has with other people. Maybe I'm trying to be for her in the way you are for me except, you know, (inaudible at 0:19:58.3). But ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That might be — it would be very bad, certainly, if I do that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be a therapist to her? [In what sense?] (ph)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not a therapist but be there with her and make it better for her in some way. You know? And if that's the role I — if I can — it's the only way I can see it making her life better for her; is by, you know, talking with her in a certain way and being a certain kind of person with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:20:33.1) What is that special thing that you ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, if I give her an enormous amount — and I think I do — if I give her an enormous amount of understanding; if I don't — or give her as much understanding as I can of her and try to make her come off the bullshit a little bit with me and she's able to do that, that would be very pleasing to me. Maybe I — just as I'm saying, maybe I'm mimicking the role that you play ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think that's beautiful, what you're saying. (respondent chuckles) I would feel — I wouldn't want you to go out and try and be a therapist or explaining people's behavior to them and putting motives into their heads and all that kind of jazz.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Oh, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But if that's what you're saying, why that's fantastic; I think it's great. And I think — I really think that's going to be a very helpful way for you to relate to an attractive woman.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. Well, that's what I meant — that's what I meant by saying that I would — you know, I was thinking of her in a certain way as a cripple. See, because that allows me to think of her as a nonformidable person (inaudible at 0:21:49.7) and someone that, you know, is just open ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) Cuts her down to a size that you can deal with.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, someone that's just open and at least — and also knows what I'm talking about when I'm talking about myself, in certain respects. You know? And it's not someone who you're talking an entirely foreign language to if you tell them something or other. (rumbling sound) What'd you do to yourself?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:16.7) My son grabbed me as I walked out the door and maybe he got me; something he had ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Strong little fellow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a strong little fellow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, he certainly is. (respondent chuckles) I'm falling all over the place. (rumbling, banging sounds) Go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He took a bite. Well ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, he isn't ... (banging sound, respondent chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. Like I said, that's the long and short of it. I don't know whether it'll work or not. We'll just have to see; just have to play it by ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're sounding very tentative right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well I am. I mean, you know, it really is sort of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you tentative about that or about our discussion we just had?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I'm not tentative about that. I'm, you know, very, very adept at — my trouble is I'm very, very adept at fantasizing these little things and ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fantasizing this relationship in the future or fantasizing what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might fantasize — all of a sudden I just became very self-conscious (ph) about the whole thing because I was waxing so enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:23:21.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I mean it might not — you know, it might not be it at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what is really great, it's really a hold (ph) for you to be able to talk that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well. Well, that doesn't mean that much to me; just to be able to talk about it. I think I've always had those kinds of (inaudible at 0:23:46.2).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) OK, that's true, that's — OK, now I completely ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Make it work. And that would be ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can see where the talking brought, in a sense (inaudible at 0:23:57.7). But I feel that you're talking about it and with a very specific plan and that's something that may come off a little bit more than your usual man-about-town.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, it's an [admission test] (ph). It's a backup routine. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Backup routine?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This one is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The man-about ... (inaudible at 0:24:19.7).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is the backup. Yes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean when you said earlier that you don't think I should be relating to her as some sort of a crippled person or something, you were afraid that I was being negative, in a sense, sort of, but what I was trying to explain wasn't entirely negative. Because it doesn't make — it makes me feel much less of a cripple if I can say intelligent things or be useful to her. You know, that's (inaudible at 0:25:06.5) that works. So, I don't know. That's why (inaudible) for the moment; just to see how that works out.</p>

<p>And you always get into these things though about — or I do, anyway — that (inaudible at 0:25:33.3) talked about all this, you know (clears throat) I never did call her up on Monday or Sunday. And I think I didn't do it because I didn't want to — I don't know why I didn't do it. I didn't want the — I became, again, full of fear and trepidation, you know? I didn't want to play it — maybe it's better to play it more casually, too, because I don't want to be calling every instant and go too fast and too far right away.</p>

<p>But you see, although it doesn't interest you to have me to speak of her specifically but, again, one of the reasons why this is plausible is because of her reactions to the people that we joined later that Saturday night and how she just tuned right out on them and — [in fact, she was a little stiff] (ph) and — but she tuned right out and she became very aggressive with me; telling me I didn't understand what she was talking about and I didn't understand her ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So how does that relate to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I — I don't know exactly how it relates to me. What's funny about it, to me, is just that she was like talking to this other person — it was this would-be (inaudible at 0:27:01.2) — and a lot of times I didn't understand her. And she always built herself up as relating to people in real ways and all that stuff was (inaudible) doing it her own way. And that annoys me a little bit, frankly, too. I mean it's just is so self-righteous in a certain way and it's not true to boot, so it's just annoying. And so she was saying this stuff to me when we left and then I affected a certain amount of anger with her. I just didn't say anything; I just — you know, like stifled a yawn and said, "OK, well we'll go home now," and she became very sort of anxious at that point and kept talking and talking and talking; trying to get me to say something or other. And that in itself was pleasing to me because it indicated something that she — that maybe she was just playing a little bit of a game.</p>

<p>But anyway, my point is that, in this, that having seen her go through that — turning out with these people — and then coming out at me about me not understanding and her dealing with people in real ways and so on and so forth, struck me, in some respects, as she was right where I am and was and so on and so forth. So I really think I understand what she's — you know. [0:28:27.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So here's a person that you understand and relate to because (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) Yes, right, right. And relate to. And have her know that, maybe, because it's very important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sounds exciting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's exciting. Right. On to the next subject.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Alright. My emotional bag is pretty nearly overdrawn, so I want to (chuckles) — I don't want to dwell in it, you see. I don't want to ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I just don't want to do it; because it might not be just right and I hate let-downs. Think it would be good just to (inaudible at 0:29:12.6). (bangs on a surface, chuckles) I get nervous (inaudible). [Just another chair, right?] (ph) (snaps fingers)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. (respondent chuckles) I don't believe that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well — so that's (chuckles) — that's the silly, the ridiculous story of winning my way in the great world; overcome this other bad habit I have of — I had allowed myself and analyzed myself to be kind of so obsessed with this one girl I went out with so many years ago. I used to think about her all the time. It was really like — what is the word — necrophilia, you know; where they — the grave robbers, you know? And that was just one of the little by-products; one of the little exhaust fumes that were (inaudible at 0:30:12.5) purge all that stuff away. [That's sort of an aggression] (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words, to have — you'd like to have some immediate good experience now so that you don't have to keep thinking about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Calling up and going over again (inaudible at 0:30:34.0).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Right. Yes, that was — that stuff was really pathetically — that was something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We've got til 7:30. That's 20 minutes. I have (inaudible at 0:30:53.3) you starting to ramble and going on. I'm curious if there's — what your intentions and goals are for the next 20 minutes; what do you want to talk about; what do you want to get done.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe (inaudible at 0:31:08.4). I don't know why.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's very — that'll ensure we get nothing done in the next 20 minutes; that kind of attitude. (respondent chuckles) Twenty minutes in this business is a pretty good block of time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I don't know. I'm still revolving around the other plan (ph).</p>

<p>(airplane passing)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Well, I'm willing to go back through] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. (inaudible at 0:31:46.6) (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sorry.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really can't do anything else within (inaudible). In that time, that's being (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible) There's only one other thing that I was thinking of — but I think I just might be rolling around on purpose — and that's trying to figure out how I'm going to relate to my parents because I think I — I was with them partly over the weekend and we (inaudible at 0:32:27.6). But I don't know how practical it would be to talk about all that. I mean the thing is I still feel the same way about them; about — only now I'm beginning to project a little bit more, you know — not anxiety but project a little bit more resentment on them than I did before. That's probably what I was talking about. And seeing our own failures is even more important for me; is a tool for me to try and get away from it and I'm still (inaudible at 0:33:08.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And think less of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Say, "Well, you're not so good after all. Look what you've done there."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: "I don't need to live up to your standards."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, and you know — yes, and just entirely rejecting them in a lot of ways. And you know, (inaudible at 0:33:27.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) That's what you're doing now? You are, in some sense, rejecting them now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean I always did in a certain way, you know? But ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) But now it's become (inaudible) surface.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) But now it's more vivid. Yes, it's more vivid for me. And I begin to think, well, you know, in a certain way, look what they did to, you know, poor, little old me, you know, and really dislike them for that and blame them. But that's — you get involved (inaudible at 0:33:58.8) inflicting a situation. You don't want to feel that way about them; makes you feel bad that you do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But at the same time, it's ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're going to talk about this, you talk about the way you feel, not the way I feel.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK. I don't want to get involved in really disliking them. I'd much rather not but I just — there isn't any way because, to me, it's too obvious; so much on the line with — I just — when I think of it now, I'm just thinking about how much, in a way, I do dislike them. You know? And it's just disturbing. You know, it's all (inaudible at 0:34:45.6). The fraudulent aspects of that thing that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... are very annoying but at the same time (inaudible at 0:35:00.6).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which would you rather do: talk about it now where you are and go on that way or if I have an idea for a little exercise, would you ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Little exercise? Alright, let's do a little exercise.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Let's mock up a mother or a father or both? Which one do you want to get a little of this resentment out on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why don't we (chuckles) — why don't we visit with dear old dad today? (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Dear old dad. Do you see him in this chair? Has he gotten (inaudible at 0:35:38.6)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, he doesn't. He's a really big guy but that's alright (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, OK. You got him there?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: This is going to be hard for me, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am fully aware of that. (chuckles) Do you think you could just take a little of that resentment and just throw it out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I could say, without getting dramatic about it, that — and I don't think I need to do much ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, you don't like the exercise. You don't want to do that. It seems too dramatic; it seems too obvious. That's what you're saying to me, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Somewhat, yes. But I'm willing to play along to a certain extent.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, so what's your ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what I ...?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's your [revised anger version] (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The problem is, as regards my father, is that in my life he strikes me as being a complete void and I — maybe I've touched on this before — but it really makes me, you know, talk about him in resentment. That is really very, very strong to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You resent his being a void. [0:37:07.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's a void and he toys with you. You know? And he ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He toys ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, with me, with me, with me. And you know what the other ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How does he toy with you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He mocks you. Mocks me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mocks me. How does he mock you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: He affects a very sardonic attitude and like he'll say something ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could you imitate him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm trying to think of it. You would say something in very earnest, say, for example.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, look, help me understand this a little bit by you saying something very earnest and then trading places and show how he'd mock you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright, I would say that ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like acting out a little bit.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would say, for example ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, say like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright, just to make it as unsubtle as possible, I would say something like it's ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Look at him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I would say it's — "I think that all the — Otto Kerner and the politicians and so forth are all crooks (inaudible) and I think that they are very low or grasping creatures and there's just no way that that can be denied by anyone. It looks that way on the face of things." And then he would just sort of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, then change chairs and give his response to that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: His response would be ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Change chairs, please.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You want me to sit in that chair? Really? Alright. This is embarrassing but I'll sit in this chair. He would ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let John have it. Don't tell me what he would say; just say it to John over there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He would say, "Oh, really? Is that your considered opinion?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the way he'd say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, much heavier, much heavier. I can't ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Try it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (pause) Oh, he might say, "I don't think that's really so. I think that, after all, these men were basically working for fees as lawyers ..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) Is that the tone of voice?</p>

<p>PATIENT: "... and if they happen to have to come around to take an additional certain sum of money that someone wanted to pay them, now the papers are construing a simple fee transaction is in some way dishonest and immoral and the paper is personally out there to sell words and they've got to write this stuff, well ..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that how he would put you down?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But do you understand why it's a put-down?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, not totally; not quite.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To me it's a complete put-down because it's not taking anything I've said honestly; not responding to what I've said at all. Because he's using an obviously fatuous argument and saying that this is sufficient to respond to my son or daughter; whoever makes such an allegation. [0:40:53.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In other words, he's not taking you seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) He's treating you a little bit invisible and coming off with ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) Right, right. And just letting it go at that. First, it's — well, I won't get into that. But this is basically the way he'd deal with it. Or he would say — let's say I proposition him with a — not so much anymore but in former times — I would proposition him with a — no, let me just sit here for a moment. I would proposition him with a business deal or something and be very earnest about it. He'd just say, "Oh, do you think so? Oh, yeah." And then he'd go on and on and he'd say, "Oh, what'd you say? Hmm?" And I'd have to repeat what I've said to him (inaudible at 0:41:41.5).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What a put-down, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And he'd say, "Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. Well, (inaudible at 0:41:45.9), John; no question about it." (inaudible) Or sometimes — he's got a little doodad that shuts off the commercials, on his little chair, and he'll fiddle with that and he'll accidentally turn it on [and like turns it off again] (ph). (chuckles) He doesn't do that in that specific context — that is to say, business deals (inaudible at 0:42:12.7) but that's really the basic attitude. It's just not like you're not even there and you're a blithering fool and scarcely worthwhile talking to because you make no sense.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But the point is, you see, that he, in my mind, is really the super — the flap, in many ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, OK. Would go over there and be (inaudible at 0:42:32.8)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I wouldn't say any of those things to him. I've never told him that and I never could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. I'm not suggesting that that's what you should do. What I'm suggesting is to run off some of your resentment by enacting a mockup of it here. I'm not telling you, "Go home and tell your father off." But I am ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. How do you want to — do you want to tell him that he's treating you as a blithering idiot? Do you want to tell him ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I really want to tell him that he's a blithering idiot. That would be the point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, tell him in a way and in the attitude in which you feel it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, for all of the ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a second. That's a very considered way of talking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, well.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that the way you talk? [0:43:37.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yes. I mean I ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would you say, "Dad, for all practical intents and purposes ..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, for the first five minutes I'd say it that way, yes. But after I got warmed up a little bit (inaudible at 0:43:47.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) OK. OK, let's here six minutes worth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) Six minutes of (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Could I hear minute five through six?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) No, (inaudible at 0:44:01.3). But the thing is that I would say that for all of his affectation of a superior attitude in these respects, that really he hadn't come to grips with anyone in his own family and that his business affairs have not been all that much of a (inaudible) success for him to get away with that. You know, if he were ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping voices) Tell him. Tell him. Just say "you" instead of ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't want to do that. I really need to talk about it in the third person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that it's completely unfair for him to adopt that attitude and what it really is, is a complete copout on his part, of having to deal with anyone in his own family, and always being at an immense reserve. And I especially resent it in terms of back to when I was younger, I really think that if he had given me much of a sign that he was around, I would have responded a lot — very readily to him. But I really think of him as being very much of a moral cipher and a coward, in many respects; because what I've seen him defend and the way he is around his children, his wife ... [0:45:40.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way he is around me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The way he is around me. Yes, he plays a — you know, he's not there and it's intolerable that he should be getting away with all this, in certain ways. And then make me feel like a ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's intolerable and it hurts that he gets away with it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, well — yes, because you know, the thing is, I want to feel towards him in an affectionate respect and he's not letting me; almost willfully, you know, by being absent and by the mockery and the attitude that his children just aren't to be taken seriously. [0:46:49.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) Well, you should continue that (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My father-in-law does that same routine and ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know what's doubly annoying about it — not to compare notes — but what's doubly annoying about it is that it's calculated to offend. It's really calculated. It's not just that he's bored.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not innocent.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's not just that he's bored; he's not innocently bored or not naively bored with what you're saying. But he wants to get at you, for some reason.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wants to just cut you right off.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I mean there's an active desire to make you aware of his, you know, dislike, in a certain way. You know? And that's what's (inaudible at 0:47:44.3). I don't understand where that comes from but it's always been there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, where does that leave you right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I'll (inaudible). (chuckles) It leaves me nowhere because I don't know how to resolve it. See, my brother has a way of doing it but my brother reacted — and I may be saying this very self-righteously but my brother's reaction of dealing with it was to adopt a different attitude but equally fraudulent; a very hearty, false-hearty ho-ho-ho kind of a thing that I never dug and I don't deal with my dad in that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what was ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: We have good moments but, you know, my brother's attitude is — he's manipulative and I'm not that way. I'm not a manipulative person but my brother is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what would you — what has been your attitude instead? What has been the way that you've dealt with it? I think before I — OK, go ahead; answer my question. I want to give you some feedback about what I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what my attitude has been. I think — you want me to tell you what I think he thinks of me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. What your — how you have behaved, communicated with him. If you can't remember, think about it. But I want to give you one piece of feedback on what happened in the little interaction that you had here — something that, if I were your father or if you were my son, would put me off a great deal — and that is you talked about Otto Kerner and these guys are complete schnooks. Anybody with half a head on their shoulders can say that but with any considered opinion at all that just — you just ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was very aggressive.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... bludgeoned and said — it wasn't — you presented with an opinion and said any — only a bloody fool would think otherwise. [0:49:57.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you had a pretty good idea that he thought otherwise.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were trying to convince him and I think you only drove him further away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:50:08.1).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, and he responded with his (inaudible) "Oh, you think so? Oh. What did you say?" You know? Which is a very — sending a lot of resentment back at you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, that's right. In a certain way, it's difficult — probably no family argues about politics and just argues about politics per se; they're all shooting each other, in a way, to drive back some personal characteristic where you're (inaudible at 0:50:44.9) because of something else. And maybe that's so (inaudible) ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I'm not saying that's just (inaudible at 0:50:55.3) that every argument is in true resentment (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: But in a certain — but maybe it's so because in the sense that I sense ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In your family, a lot of these feelings are that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Personal resentments.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I sense that — well, I sense that he would be right in there in the den of thieves if he could make it and that's annoying. He really would. He's the kind of a guy that would have loved to have been one ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's really, really annoying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: He's the kind of guy that would have loved to have been the city building inspector. And we have houses from here all the way to Florida, every ten miles, because of all the money we make and if he could have swung that, he would have done it. And you know, feeling that — it's a very na�ve thing, I agree.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's a na�ve thing? [0:51:51.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: For me to feel that way about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who are you agreeing with? I didn't say that was a na�ve thing. What are you saying? It's a na�ve thing for you to feel what way about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's a na�ve way for me to feel so morally righteous about him wanting to graft a little money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm not saying that's na�ve. I don't — (inaudible at 0:52:18.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) No, no. I'm responding to him, though. I guess I'm really responding to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what I'm saying is this; the reason why I would be — adapt that tone is because — you're right, I am throwing darts at him; I am being aggressive and (inaudible at 0:52:30.0) when I'm saying, "Look, you're a crook just like the rest of them, you old fart." You know? And then he's ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow, that's pretty tough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles) And then he's adapting by, you know, blowing me off and saying just some posturing, pompous argument that wouldn't hold water anywhere and just saying, "Well, that's not for you." And — but you know, he does that in other contexts, too. But as far as being na�ve is concerned, what I'm trying to say is that maybe it's na�ve of me to ever expect him to understand my attitude. He expects me to understand his attitude, number one, because he is convinced that the world is a big, shooting war, you know, and you just go out and get whatever you can and you're damned lucky to have it. That's his attitude. Since he has had a modicum of success, he considers me as being sheltered and unaware while sharks are swimming in the ocean; which I'm finding that may be true, incidentally. [0:53:38.2]</p>

<p>But at the same time — you see what I'm trying to say? So you get down to that and I'm saying, "Well, no, that's not true and I want you to be Sir Galahad, goddamnit."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. One piece of feedback to you on that topic is — honestly, what's the simplest way for me to say it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I could follow it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could follow a reasonably complex (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't know if I could get it out that complex way and have me understand it, much less you. OK, what I want to say is — I have to go into a personal example. That's just the easiest way for me to do it. I'm very different from my family, too, and I've gotten a lot of s*** from being an oddball, bookworm; "book drunk" is what I was called when I was a kid.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Never heard that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Given a decree that I had to start getting average grades because all this book stuff is really rude. But anyway, there's a whole lot of things and I could get laurels from everybody else but my parents would pass it off. Everybody else would brag about their kids but my parents wouldn't mention what I'd done, which was twice as good as the people that were bragging to them. You know, that whole kind of thing. And I got very, very, very hurt. And I know that a lot of my energy in adolescence and since then has been kind of directed back to them and saying, "Hey, will you see how good I am? Will you see, will you see, will you see?" and I spent so much energy in that.</p>

<p>Finally I got to the point where [I'm literally saying] (ph), "OK, just think what you do and I'll go about and do my thing." And in doing my thing, I got a hell of a lot of energy freed up; rather than having them confront that what I did was OK. That wasn't what was most important for me anyway. What was most important was for me to be able to be me and work out what my thing was. [0:55:45.4]</p>

<p>Similarly, if — OK, if your father really is a schnook, in some sense, about business deals, et cetera, for him to be able to admit to his son, "I am a schnook," think of what that would demand of him; just like what it would demand of my — I think it would demand even more of my parents. But think of what that would demand because, in some ways, your father is a moral, Catholic man, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And to confront that what he was doing came head on like that and they didn't meet to a son who's his junior, who doesn't know about all the sharks in the ocean and all that bit, you know, that — you're demanding a great deal from him as a starting point. I mean it's kind of like you're saying, "Hey, you accept this and then we can be friends. You accept how terrible you are and then we'll go on from there." Granted, he may really be a schnook but it's just like you're holding up his biggest barrier and saying, "OK, jump through it and then come to me. Why can't you come to me?" kind of thing. And I think that you can know, in your own awareness, that OK, "He's a schnook and I resent him for being a schnook," without having to take it to him; for the first thing. You know. Mock him up some other place and be furious about it but don't expect him to recognize. Don't expect him to recognize. [0:57:23.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping voices) Yes, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Someday he may but that's not the point. That's not his working level.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's not what's going to be most beneficial to you right now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it isn't. I agree with you but I think because — it's like fighting a battle that's irrelevant, in a certain way, and hopefully (inaudible at 0:57:42.5). I can understand this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes. Here is the war and this is a distracting skirmish.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Well, you know I can see that that's right but ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, but where does that leave you emotionally and what do you do ...?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to be able to, you know — I'd like to be able to work at — right, it's a set piece battle and I'd rather have it resolved in some way — although I recognize what you're saying, it probably can't be resolved because there's no way that he's ever going to confess anything of that kind to me and perhaps I'm being pretty brutal with my asking it; for asking him to confess that. But it's like for some reason that's very important to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because, see, I internally (ph) blame a lot of what's happened to me on all of that whole complex of ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's only true if you accept it that's it your problem. That doesn't have to prevent you from having a really great success of your own, you know, totally divorced from that s***. If you can just divorce yourself from it; if you can say, "OK, those are your models. Those are your money marbles. I don't want that game" and just disconnect yourself. [0:59:21.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: What did it involve in your part? Does it involve giving up a way of life that your parents may have expected you to follow?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, it involved not looking to them for — it involved not looking to them to say I was OK. It involved ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Would they have preferred you to go to the University of Wisconsin and go to football games and get married and go to (inaudible at 0:59:41.8)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, it would have been even better if I hadn't even gone to college.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or if I'd gone to college, I should have been a school teacher.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That was the really deal, huh?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And married somebody and been a housewife. You know. And somebody that didn't make much money. That'd be a good idea, too. (respondent chuckles) And a guy who liked to fish and hunt and you know. You know, everybody has their own straight, little, narrow way. My family ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think one of the things that I'm trying to get at is that in order for you to make your parents conceptions irrelevant, you broke away from their lifestyle. You know. In other words, you made their judgments — they just didn't apply to you because you're in a different ballgame. [1:00:35.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And where does that leave you? You're in the same ballgame?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I was going to say that in a certain respect, because of the fact that maybe on the surface I've accepted some of those ...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, but that doesn't mean that you have to have them as a standard of whether you succeed at that ballgame or not. Yes, in some real areas, my parents and I are still in the same ballgame. Like they're very religious people. I am also very religious but it's — you know, I mean OK, you may be very interested in high finance. Your dad's very interested in money. But I bet your perceptions are that you're going to go about making that money in a very different way. You know. [1:01:25.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, yes. That's right. And you know, I can see, in a certain way, what you're saying is absolutely true and the thing to do is to find some way to make their life so irrelevant, in a certain way, to me; whereas (inaudible at 1:02:01.5) the fact that I just allow it and I'm still (inaudible) in a certain way, too. I don't know. I'm really mixed up at this point.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I'm trying to say is that I think everything you said is very persuasive and I would agree with it. But I just haven't (inaudible at 1:02:23.0).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes, yes. That makes sense. I'm glad you're going through those gyrations. To me, that means I've had a lot more impact than if you'd said, you know — OK, granted; another part of this is it's a lot easier said than done. You know. I said, "OK, here's how — here's what I did." I didn't tell you how I did it or all those gyrations. But that's, again, something that we can be working on here in the next eight times that you come. In terms of finding ways to just loosen that bond and get out the resentment, yes, and just making more of a separation where you can come and be resentful and go and do your own thing and not be continually roped (ph) into ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, right. Yes, I agree. There's no question I'm too roped (ph) in and that has a way of making the resentment all that more forceful than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [That's in such fashion] (ph) that I mentioned once I scandalized my sister by (inaudible at 1:03:38.2) story about why our parents got married and (inaudible). (chuckles) But — well, that wasn't bad for 20 minutes then; 20 minutes work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, which turned into half an hour. Well, I'm good, good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I liked it.</p>

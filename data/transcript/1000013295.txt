<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...they used to have at this [inaudible at 0:00:05.2]... for years. I prayed for that summer to not have flicks (ph).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. All right</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, I keep thinking how much longer can I...I'm getting it cut on Friday. I don't think I'm ready to do anything radical yet...but it's just, this has almost grown out...it's just like in the way, part of it and so. And I remembered to bring you pictures, I found them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, of your new brother?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wish I could've talked to you about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [inaudible at 0:00:44.4]... [still inaudible - whispering]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And he's so cute.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then that was the one, the hug for a new mother.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. (chuckling) These are really adorable. They really are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then this was the backyard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, you still look very similar. This looks like you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) I only picked the...sort of the way I stand in this. It's like, well, I know what that feels like. That's why I stand like...boy. And this one must have been a birthday part, but that was my mom and her auntie, she lived upstairs.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. That's when you were really little. You were two. That's like your second birthday party.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And then these must have been on the same day...because we were just playing in the backyard. This was just another birthday party. That was my cousin, Seth Fleisch, who I was going to marry. He was... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This cousin?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were supposed to marry him [in these pictures?] (ph) [0:02:08.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. It was me. I had decided I was going to marry him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, you had decided you were. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. He was my first cousin I found.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So you want a really good one? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, well, these are really nice pictures.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. [audio break at 0:02:22.1]... nice just to [inaudible]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's nice to be able to look at...your house and your yard and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [...do you regret anything?] (ph) [0:02:31.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's interesting too, because I have a picture of him trying to, I know I have it in the apartment carefully stored so it doesn't get...warped. I can't quite find it but it's a picture of my dad and his two sisters and brother and their parents in the backyard...the same backyard, and I was thinking that might be a fun montage to put together...these pictures in the backyard, stretching over however many years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. So how does it make you feel when you look at these old pictures of when you were a kid?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, a lot of mixed feelings. A lot of mixed feelings. It's like...I have very clear memories of being that age and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...being... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Even two? Even when you were just two?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wow!</p>

<p>PATIENT: I have memories that go back that far. And...it's just a lot of mixed feelings. Sometimes I feel sad and sometimes I feel like...I wasn't that cute. And I think sometimes I feel sad...I have a picture of my brother and it just, that's one thing I've begun doing. I have a whole group of film that I need to get developed. It's too long a story to go into, but I had a 35MM camera. I really love photography and it's something I've often thought I'd like to pursue like a hobby.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was home one summer a couple of summers ago and there was a terrible accident. My dad had rented a car. I was going to be home for a chunk of time and I went out to see Caine and Sue and I was out in the backyard with Joseph. And I put the camera down on the trunk of the car, which I, and even as I did it I thought, "Oh, you shouldn't do that." Then it was time to eat, we went in to eat. Caine came home and he said, "Hey, would you run down to the corner and get me a paper?" "Oh, fine. Come on Joseph let's go." So we get in the car, go down to the corner and get the paper. As we're coming back up the road, I look and I thought, "Is that a snake or what?" No, it was the camera...it had just...died. So Caine and Sue bought me one of the automatic ones. And I really, I mean, it's fine for snapshots but it's not, (chuckling) it's not the same.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. If you're serious about... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or a little serious about [overlapping voices at 0:05:12.1]... childhood [inaudible]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because it's like the timing is just off. You don't get what you shot. It's just like always a piece of this later. And for some reason I just stopped getting any film developed that I took. And I thought about that...it's kind of like, almost a symbolic like punishment..., "You see your dad girl? No, you don't. You hurt. You're the camera. You..." It was the second camera.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How long ago was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, it would have been '89 maybe.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, so it's been a while.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think it was '89. But I've begun taking...one roll at a time in to be developed and just to see what's there you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But getting back to that...that roll I developed was from last year. I went to see Justine, she was going to be in the Junior Olympics for swimming, and I took the bus out to Northern Virginia and took some pictures. And when I got them developed, I mean...my brother just looked so old... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...in them, so tense. And...I just look at...the little boy in that picture and I just think, "Well...but that's life and that's what happens." You know when I see the picture of my mom it makes me very sad...I miss her. I wonder what it was like for her coming to live in that town, living so far away from all of her family. When I see the picture of my auntie and my mom at the table...as an adult I can realize what kind of pull must have been going on between the two of them. But I just...it brings up a lot of feelings, so, but not all...not all sad I mean. I think it was really nice that we had a backyard to play in and I can remember...the different things we used to do in the backyard and it's pleasant you know. My grandmother would have a wonderful garden because there were still remnants of it left.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it looked nice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It looked like a nice place to play.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It really was...adventure. (chuckling) The tree and all the little...the roots from the trees that...we used to use for the cars and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean to [inaudible at 0:07:53.7]... into cars?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No, the real car's not that old. (both chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When you ran into the street. (chuckling) So, and then that swing set, that was something dad made for us out of, he got old metal ladders from the telephone company and...welded them and folded them together so that, it was like two sets of, the two ladders made a V and then there were two bars that went across. One bar for the swing and the other bar was a ladder that went sideways and we could...crawl along...and then we'd climb up the ladder and go down the other side and go up. I mean it was, it was just really fun.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But, so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what's it like to show me those pictures and share some more of these...things from your childhood with me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I liked it...I wanted to do that. I just like sharing them...part of the continuity or...part of the, it's funny because I was thinking, during this week one of the other tutors was talking to me and she's the one that's moving on to Talbert (ph) Einstein, and so we were talking about...just careers and...work and things like that. And it was really funny because what she said to me was...she said, "I remember meeting you at East High Street, not this past May but the May before." And she said, "The thing that striked or struck...really hit me the most was your sense of self confidence and your sense of really...being very knowledgeable and sure of yourself." And all of that. And I thought, "Whoa!" It's just that feeling of...that in a way that when I come in here, I show you...the very vulnerable...the hurting part, but that there are many other parts, like meaning (ph) the world you know. I think there, it struck me in that way that, and also the feeling of, "Yeah, maybe at that time I did feel that way. I no longer feel that way." Or... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think that's true? [0:10:39.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in certain ways I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you felt... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Like professionally I should.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...more self confident when you were at East High Street?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think there was, at the time she meant...I probably still had a semblance of, yeah, I've learned something and...there are things I would like to do and directions I'd like to go in. Because it wasn't really enough, any experience at Saint Anne's that...hadn't just been eroded away and worn down...just gone, gone. And listening to the way Kelly described how she decided...because of her, she has a young son and she knew when she finished East High Street that she was going to put together some part-time... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, this is the one who... </p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because she needed the flexibility. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And...she was determined that, that was what she was going to do until she could parlay that into a full-time thing. And I was thinking, "Learn from that...learn that...there are many different ways of maneuvering and doing things...that..." I mean I think in certain ways a lot of what I've felt is just, maybe throwing the baby out with the bath water...it's just like..., "Oh, I've had it with that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well...and I want to get back to this, I feel like it's really important and it's making me think what you were saying about the tutoring right now at Ryder.  But I wanted to, before we get too far from it, point out something that I think, it feels like a familiar thing that happens between us, but it's always sort of subtle and, so that I'm not sure of like when to point it out but, I notice that when I asked you how you felt about showing me the pictures, and it is sort of an intimate thing to share, and you said, "Oh, it was nice." And then sort of swallowed and your voice got a little quieter for a minute. And then you started talking about this other strong side of you that this woman had seen at East High Street. And so it was a related story...and it's definitely like on the topic and I see how you would make that connection, but I had a feeling of like, and I think it's a familiar thing of uncomfortableness about talking about closeness or really just staying with the moment of sharing something close. [0:13:35.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that make any sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I'm sure it does. I'm sure that...when you said that the first time...I could feel myself kind of...pulling back a little bit. What went up in my mind...immediately was, "What should I say? It's like, well, yeah, I showed them to you because I wanted to share that with you."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "What more should I say?" You know... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That, that was what came up...in the unedited version. Like I don't know what else to say. Did you like them? You know, no, no, I mean, I shared them, this is part of who I am. But yet, I could feel that. And then I began thinking, "Well, why did you bring them in? What..." I think that's all a part of what was going on in that whole world...like maybe a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, because then you started talking about the, you feel like you bring the vulnerable part of yourself in and that I might not see, like how you're...efficient and self confident at work. And maybe it was about...making yourself a little vulnerable by bringing them in and then I might talk about...talk about it. But I think it's really interesting that even in this point, when vulnerability or being a little more open comes up, that immediately again, you go to blaming yourself in some way. "Oh, why did I bring them in?" That's a...so, and I wasn't feeling that at all. I was really feeling, "Wow, that was a nice thing." And I feel like you get a sort of an understanding of somebody by seeing their past and what lovely looking yard and kids and...looked so nice. But I think that the pattern is interesting and worth taking a look at, because...vulnerability, that's part of closeness and sharing it. It kind of seems like that's an uncomfortable feeling for you. Or... [0:16:26.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, well, I'm sure it is. I mean, like what you're reminding me of is, I was watching Law & Order last night and knew he watches it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I came into it late and it was a story about a father and daughter. And it was very much about feelings and...this was a man whose only family was his daughter and...had reappeared in her life and all that. And I remember thinking, "Oh, I bet Dad's not watching this at all." Or...is really not enjoying it, because I don't think ever in my family could feelings ever be shared. Not with mom and me, but even there, I mean, there were layers of...constraint. But...just as part of life and part of living though, and so, even when that begins to happen, it just feels uncomfortable. It's not painful or it's not like, "Ooh, I want to get away from it." It's just kind of uncomfortable. Because it's not something that comes easily. But I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You said, "It's not that I want to get away from it." But I feel you do pull away from it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I do but I think it's at two different levels. I mean intellectually I don't want to.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But emotionally...it's just this learned response that just kicks in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uncomfortableness?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, well, of your...you feel me pulling away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's the emotional response. It's not intellectually that I want to... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...or...in my mind. It makes me feel like an ameba...like in a petri dish that...you probe it with the...with a needle in it... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it like pulls away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...and it just goes... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's nothing, it just does it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And also what's interesting is, it also goes into like self criticism somehow. This is it, this is... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...feet (ph). No. (chuckling)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean this, it didn't seem like a situation where self [inaudible at 0:18:54.1]... this would necessarily come in. It seems like...that was part of how you pull away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. It's like... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As opposed to really part of the situation necessarily.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah, it's a, I come, I don't think I've said this to you but...somehow I feel with meditation what I've come to see is when I, what I call my "knotted" world...because it's just awful, (chuckling) twisted around in a real painful posture...where everything becomes a pain inflicting...something...but it's very hard for me to just remain in comfortable [inaudible at 0:19:42.3]... that do okay at place no matter what...no matter what interaction's going on. It makes me crazy. It does in a way I don't know how to stop that...because, and then that makes me even crazier because then I think, "Ooh...you'll never get over that." You know it's just that... [0:20:09.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What makes you crazier, being a little [overlapping voices at 0:20:10.9]... aware?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My sense of myself as being so...pain inflicting with myself that...then it, then I just say, "Relax...this was a lifetime of one (ph) behavior."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "And it's not going to go away over night."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, the other thing is it's part...it's the awareness of it, it's not, it isn't going to change over night but by becoming more aware of it and trying to be accepting, instead of critical when it happens. Just trying to be aware and accepting, it will shift some how and gradually and slightly. It's not going to be like you're going to completely change, but I do think that it will shift with the growing awareness of when this happens. What are you thinking about? I feel like you've gone onto the next thing... </p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I haven't gone onto the next thing...it's very hard for me to believe that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean it's very hard for me to believe that, that's all that, I have to believe it because I want...that very much but, I think I'm feeling very loaded (ph) and so it feels like I just want to say, "Oh, yeah? Oh, really?" You know like, "You really think so? Well, I don't." Then I say, "Oh, yeah, right. So let's just guarantee that it won't ever..." I hope it does. I mean, I hope it changes because, I don't know how to do that easily. And when I think of the friends I have, when we do share, I know that it's taken a long time to build those friendships...that it's not something I've ever done easily or quickly or...but I have done it but it's not... And then I start self doubting and say, "Well, maybe your friendships really aren't..." [overlapping voices at 0:22:53.6]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this sort of ties back into what we were talking about last week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like maybe I think that, well, I know but [inaudible at 0:23:02.9]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's this whole internal dialogue, I mean, this seems to be a really loaded issue, in the sense that there's like so many different thoughts that come along, and some of them are hard to share with me. Like, "Well, oh, yeah, I don't believe it." I feel like I had to pull that out of you. So what do you think was holding you back from saying that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because when I hear that, it sounds so black and so, ooh...that I think, well, that..., "Oh, well, great...that's the pity pot...that's not at...that may be how you're feeling but it's not the way I want to feel." It just feels so black...a hopeless kind of thing and I don't want to feel hopeless. I really don't and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So part of you believes that and part of you doesn't want to believe it or doesn't believe it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't believe it. I mean, I think... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, no, but I mean there's a part of you that either doesn't want to believe it or actually doesn't believe it. I mean, maybe I'm not making myself clear. So part of you says, "I don't believe it. I don't believe this is going to change."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But then there's another part of you that is saying, "Well, I don't want to feel that I'm never going to change."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But does that part also think, "Well, I could change." Or is it part of, it just doesn't want to believe that you can change but, in fact, you completely believe that you're not going to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, the part that says, "Oh...of course you're going to change."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know is much stronger than the part that says, "Oh, it's never going to change." That to me is the little six-year-old kicking her legs and saying, "Nah, nah." (chuckling) You know and the other one has to say..., "Of course you're going to change. You have changed in your life and you will continue to change. And it may not feel pleasant and it may feel uncomfortable and it may not be easy and it may not happen fast...but hopefully by the time you're 70...you'll be able to experience (chuckling) some sense of, maybe shared intimacy that's meaningful."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, okay, there's also a lot of self criticisms that I'm hearing, including that I bring up this point that I thought you sort of pulled back from, the feeling of shared intimacy, and then, but I still felt it. I think that, that was still real, even though maybe it was an uncomfortable thing you had to pull back. It doesn't mean that it wasn't there. Or getting back to our last week's conversation, now you're all of the sudden doubting any intimacy with anybody. That's not what I'm saying. I mean I know that you have close friends and I know you know you can really share things with some people. And it's, you don't want to do that with everybody right away, and...it's so it's not so much an all or nothing thing. Do you know what I mean? And then yet there's this whole self criticism of yours that comes in and says, "Oh, well, I can't do that. I'm not doing..." It's not. It's about an awareness of how that can be uncomfortable with somebody you don't know as well, like me. [0:26:54.1]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or how you can be with it for a minute and then it's uncomfortable and then you pull away...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Pull, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...and start criticizing... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...or doubting or, so it's more about the awareness of how that can happen, how it can cut it off. Not that you're not, you never do it or that... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...that moment isn't real.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know there's something that I need to tell you, because I'm thinking as you're talking, it's like, did I tell you last week I stopped drinking coffee?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) I mean it's been like a week ago Friday. And I've heard people talk and share about what they go through and I'm thinking, "Oh, well, good...because this is part of it...where it's like the last layer of...that gets between your feelings and...stuff." Because I think that's part of what I'm feeling...it's just like aye! You know and just the sensation of...there's nothing in between the feeling. You know what I mean? There's not a smoke screen or of smoke or whatever.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And in a way I think it's just like a heightened awareness. Like when you brought that up it was like saying, "Oh, yeah, that is what I do." And, yeah, I mean, you experienced it just right then and it's like part of feeling (ph) with the raw nerves. And it's like, I think giving up coffee is harder for me than alcohol ever was. I mean, I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Really?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah! I hated alcohol. I hated the taste of it. I hated what it did to me. I hated it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So tell me about what this feeling is now without the coffee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I feel deprived. (chuckling) I feel sad. I feel emotionally distraught. (chuckling) Not quite because, I mean, there have been times in my life where I've drunk more coffee than I do right now. But it's just like, I never realized what an emotional crutch it was for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, but it sounds like there's also some feeling of more, maybe vulnerability or irritability or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, all of the above. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...all of those?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of the above. It's just, it's like when I was waking one morning... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because those things like, may be related to more to what we're talking about and like, how it is to be with somebody...how it is to be with me right now. It seems like maybe the vulnerability and the irritability are sort of, you're feeling them. [0:30:03.3]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like...when I would wake up in the morning and I'd think, "Oh, have a cup of coffee." And make it...and it was a ritual...because I'd use the [inaudible at 0:30:14.3]... heater...single cup...just the whole ritual of making it and then drinking it...breathing for a little bit...or going...just walking down the street and walking past the Starbucks and smelling, "Oh, good coffee." (chuckling) You know and just, it's a feeling of, "Oh, I can't do that any more." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So deprived, so you feel a little deprived too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, definitely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what lead up to the quitting the coffee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think I'd known for a long time that eventually, that I would do it, because I really think that sobriety is a spiritual path. I mean it really is, it's a spiritual program, and caffeine is a drug. And I knew, I mean, I could look at myself with my little rituals...and thinking of waking up and thinking, "You know, yeah, you're really hooked on this. You really like it." And it really...you put a lot of emotion into it. And eventually, if you really want to live a sober life, you have to let go of that...that, that's a block. And then I think once I began...the breathing and meditation, say if I'd met someone, like Becky for dinner, and I would have a cup of coffee after dinner, I could really tell the difference in meditation.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was harder to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, I mean just...it was like, "Oh, yeah, breath? Ha, ha!" (both chuckling) You know, it's just...totally different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was just, and I also realized in the morning that I was drinking less of the coffee I made...that I would just sort of...get busy doing other things and then say, "Oh, I didn't finish it." And I was thinking, "Oh, well...this may be the time to let go of it." And then when I went to the doctor, who spoke at the...last, the open workshop I went to about the mind/body thing, she talked about caffeine...and...the high you get and then you fall. "Oh, I'm feeling a little sleepy. Have a cup of coffee." Now at the point I gave it up, I really wasn't drinking huge amounts. But I heard that and I thought, "Hmm."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So is there a good side to giving up coffee? I think I've heard all the bad things. [0:32:59.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (chuckling) I can feel the difference in my skin. My sleep is getting [overlapping voices at 0:33:06.8]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How's your, your skin feels better?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah, like smoother and...not as, a little touchy...sensitive. My sleep pattern has changed even more. I mean, I get longer, deeper chunks of sleep at night. Meditation I'm still struggling with but I think that's part of getting into meditation. I'm going to talk to people. I really have more energy, that's real interesting...where I wake up in the morning and I'm just awake and so, yeah, I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There are a lot of good things, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, yeah. And I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...I'm not going to not...do it, but it's just so interesting to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what about this feeling? You're feeling a little more, like there's not as much of a barrier with people? Is that feeling like, is that sort of a positive and negative?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's positive and negative. You know one other reason I did it when I did, was because I wanted to do it when we were still in therapy... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because I was very curious to see (chuckling) whether it would...have an effect.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it seems to be. Doesn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckling) Yeah!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'm glad.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean not, it's not that you seem like a different person, but it seems to have come up right in the first week, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you quit a week ago?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. But...one thing happened that...on Saturday at the [Farmer's Market] (ph) [0:34:38.9], when I thought, "Oh, yeah." You know, I was just so much more aware of feeling a little comfortable and it wasn't as bad as the week before, because I... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so what happened?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I went back and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...fully intending to be...just...out there. (chuckling)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I got there...I got there later... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...because I was meeting friends and so I went later in the afternoon. As I came in, I saw Jerry walking, he wasn't at the fruit stand. And I saw him and I called out and I said, "Jerry?" But he didn't hear me. And then it was as though I was back in sixth grade, sixth or seventh grade. And it was like, I thought, "Well, I'm not going to keep walking to the apple stand." Because I knew he was not there. But I didn't go after him and say, "Hi, how are you?" I just sort of turned away and pretended to be looking at another stand, and waited until I saw him walking back, because I saw that he was buying something to eat. And then when I got up to the stand, they were in the process of kind of taking it apart. They were still waiting on people and, or...the [overlapping voices at 0:35:55.6]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That last of the last weekend?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What's not there are the kids.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It was just Janice and...Jerry and the other brother. And he was busy, I mean, he really only said hello, but he didn't say anything about the tape...the guitar tape or anything. And I bought just one apple and Janice washed it for me and gave it to me. And he came over and he said something like, "Oh, you're here late today." And I said, "Well, yeah, I'm meeting friends." But I walked away feeling very, like I blew it...like, I felt really angry at myself and I felt really, not angry, not angry the way I have in other times. It was almost like, puzzle, like..., "What happened in Jane? Did you..." He could have had the tape and he just couldn't get it for you, which I knew. It was just like that feeling of...like having missed a connection.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's interesting to me how you also, you feel angry at yourself...to just be aware of that. What did you do? I mean, it seems like that's more an automatic reaction to something missing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know, like it just, it seems like it just happened. You didn't do or not do anything. I sounds like, "Well, last week and this week I'll..." You know, there was sort of, there wasn't the same kind of like, through fun, excited connection that you had felt with Janice and Jerry on other days. But then the fact that you would attribute it to like, yourself, when it just sounds like it was something that just didn't click.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I guess the part that made me feel angry was, well, why didn't I go out...when I saw him and he didn't hear me, why didn't I go up and say, "Hey, Jerry, hi, how are you?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, that I felt so, like it goes back to what you were just saying about the pictures...where... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...where it would've been a chance to say hello to him, without the whole... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...fish bowl atmosphere.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I just withdraw...it's like I can't put myself out there, into a situation like that, where, and I know even as I'm telling you, it's like making something much bigger than what it actually was. And then I get angry at myself and say, "Well, but, so is that what your life is going to be...all these things that aren't really anything but you try to gain meaning from them but they're...not that big a thing?" Then I get real frantic.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So, Jane, I feel like there's so many things where they're all leading back to you criticizing whatever you're doing and whatever reaction you're having to what you're doing. You know, where in fact, you're trying to be more aware. You're trying to, you went back there purposely to sort of talk to them and...and you're doing a lot of things that are positive for yourself and quitting caffeine and...there are a lot of ways where you're trying ensure that you are going to be open, more aware and changing and doing positive things, and yet at every turn I feel like you're finding a way to... [0:39:29.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's funny as you're saying that, because another thing I did do this week, I really began working on my resume...where I...I did sit at the computer and I got information down and...the information that Daphne helped me with... </p>

<p>ANN (?): Yes I did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...got that in, and I began doing more...written work. I'm feeling really terrible about that. I don't...and I just feel really bad. I just feel so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what's up? So let's, you're feeling bad about the resume, too?</p>

<p>ANN (?): Oh, yeah, that's... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're just stuck [inaudible at 0:40:10.4]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, in a way what I feel like is that, when I think about it I think that's what has begun this sabotage...because I really do feel it's almost like a pebble under the saddle.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which then...makes the whole horse...so uncomfortable, but it's really, that's been the trigger for me...and not having sent it into the Lighthouse. And I lied to Daphne...and Caine...it's like a sin, sin...not even in the Catholic Church thing... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's immediately what I thought of when you, too, when you said that you lied. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I thought at one point...that this is really what I learned in [post Vatican II Theology....] (ph) [0:40:54.8] what sin does...it just, it does become, it erodes so...it just, it's not healthy, it's not good. Because she asked me...she said, "Well, did you send it in?" And I said, "Yes!" Because in a way... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When was that? When was that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that was like a week ago, or more. And in a way, when I said that I thought, "Well, now you have to get it in."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: "You get it in fast."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I didn't...and so it just eats in my soul, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Now, I think it's important if you...to get more aware of the fact that you feel like this is really an underlying irritant that's making this self criticism more apparent and [inaudible at 0:41:41.0]... because it sounds like this is something really important for you to feel more...finish or feel more clear about, and so that it doesn't start to influence... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...other things. What do you feel has been holding you back from, what happens, like when you sit down to write it? You have the draft. You have a lot of information. You have people to send it to. What happens when you sit down and try to work on it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel like I'm looking at a plate of spaghetti and...that I'm trying to put together something that doesn't make any sense to me. I have one copy of a resume that I like a lot, from my time at the UCS. It looks good. It's the way I want my resume to look. And then I go to the education stuff and it just begins to swim and I just feel so angry at it...and it just feels to me, I just realize I have so much anger. And that really upsets me because I don't know how to make it go away.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anger about what or at what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think anger that I failed. Anger that I really thought that I could build something new and the feeling that I haven't. Trying to pull all these different little pieces of things together and make them be...something. And I say to myself, "I'm not even sure that's what I want to do anymore." And then I feel really backed in a corner, like, "Well, if you're not going to do that, then what are you going to do?" Feeling like I just blew it...just all that's realized. I'm telling you, I just realized that's really what's going on...it's just, and then it just permeates everything else you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I feel like you're holding back even how upset I've been and how upset you are about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think I probably am, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that because of Ian (ph)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. [inaudible at 0:44:12.7]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: And it's just...it's feeling, again, this is a life pattern, too, and I'm trying very hard not to do it, but that's...of judging myself according to other people, what other people are doing...and...what Joan says to me is, "Look." She said, "You are so calm." She said, "You have such a presence about you." She said, "You don't know what a selling tool that is." She said, "You don't know how many parents have said to me, 'Well, you're a little too peppy.'" And like when she said, "That's what you have to sell...with the work that you do with students."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So...it's, and then I say to myself, "Well, what's holding you back from just saying, 'Well, this is what I do.' The fact that I don't really believe in learning disabilities anymore, is that what it is?" Because I really don't. I think it's a garbage term. I think it's a dumping ground for all kinds of other things. I read this story about Dalton (ph), I don't know if you've read that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: In the Times. Did I ever tell you about my whole process of interviewing there?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now that's another story for another time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, but I think, yeah, we should focus on what's going on now or next.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But it's like this feeling of being in this... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought that was really interesting thought, the way it pointed out how you can take people and like label them... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh! (making a noise)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...disability, when, yeah. So that's the kind of thing you're talking about, about a shift in your thinking about things or... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but I mean, so that's... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...there are other people? Well, I don't want to get too caught... </p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...up like learning disabilities but... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that's with the intellectual side of it. [overlapping voices at 0:46:14.0]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...side of it. Exactly. And I'm... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, but the feeling... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, tell me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...part of it, Sarah is like, feeling like I've...I hate to get backed in the morning, because it isn't just about what I thought. It's like, "What if they're not, in the middle of this thing?" And so, "You know what? This is bull shit...this is crap." I work with kids who are little, I mean first of all, Cecilia and Bailey do not belong in college. Why they are...they've been labeled learning disabled, so then they get along...it makes me so angry at the system. It makes me so angry. Well, I just have so much anger.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But again, this is like what we were talking about before with the intimacy or not or close or not. It's not a black and white thing. I mean, it's not all bull shit and it's certainly not all done well. [0:47:13.0]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean these kids need some kind of... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Services, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...services, even if the labeling is, anyway... </p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...so it seems to me like it's not so black and white but there's a lot of frustration there and also a lot of it about...at yourself... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...too. I keep thinking with the resume that, how would it be, can you think of it, we were talking before about your saying, "My resume is not me." Or something. And "My resume is not my world." And that seemed to like, have a sense of like, "Oh, yeah, it's not." There seemed to be some relief in being able to remember that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then also, that I don't see the resume as so black and white, it's an evolving thing. There's not going to be one perfect resume.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I'm thinking, well, is it hard for, what would it be like if you saw it as more an evolving thing and you just send out the best version you have to the The Arcand keep working on it for the next one?</p>

<p>PATIENT: On that day, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it, is that a hard thing for you to... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you ever think of it, just sort of as an evolving thing? "I'll send the best version I have now because there's an opportunity."</p>

<p>PATIENT: I actually do. I mean I actually do and that was my plan, to just say, "Look, I'm going to pull all the good stuff from the editorial...because that's what the job is about at The Arc." I have not seen it advertised, so who knows...they may not even be, I mean, do you know, I even think of that to myself...that, who knows what's happening there? And this is all about what's happening in here. I mean... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...just to bat something out and... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, I don't mean from scratch. I mean, you have a lot of work done already.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I can do that and just to say to myself, I've tried doing this, to say, "Can you imagine the relief you will feel? Can that be a [inaudible at 0:49:11.0]... to know that once you get that done you're going to feel a lot better.?" And just still, I mean, one thing I have begun realizing is, that I need to work away from the apartment a certain amount of time. So...I worked in the park over the weekend on it. And I guess that's what happens, too, I just start feeling like everything is like a caramel mess. Because the apartment then becomes...just, I can't be in it, and it's really messy now. And then I start attacking myself for that. Do you know? It just all feeds on itself. And I try to step out and say, "Wait, wait." You know? [0:50:06.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: When we finish today...I will have a chunk of time that I can work on it. And my goal for today...I'd like to say it out loud because maybe it will help me keep to that, is...to type out a brief cover letter...that just says, "I'm sending this at suggestion of my friend..."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is the big influence in most job situations.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And then just...type out as close to the form...that the other one as I can. I'm going to try messing with the computer because that will just make me angrier at myself that...I still don't know all the margins and all that. I have a typewriter. I'll just type it out. And then either mail it or take it in, in person. Because then I start thinking, "Oh, yeah, and there you have to do a brief summaries on each of the students, like area, and..." And I'm realizing that's a pattern, too. [inaudible whispering at 0:51:20.0]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not feeling so built up, let things sort of [overlapping voices at 0:51:24.9]... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like all of the sudden..., "You have to do that but you have to do this, too." [inaudible at 0:51:30.0]... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we're going to have to stop. But I think it would be good if during the week, this week, you can try to be aware of how this self criticism is coming in all the time. You know, just try to be aware of it, because it seems to be really happening on a lot of fronts right now. And...see how that's happening and maybe getting in the way of your getting things done or enjoying things or, and use that awareness of how uncomfortable it's been for you not to have just sent out the resume or the letter, to help you to...get over that hump.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then also to remember things we've talked about, about it...not being yourself, it's not... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's just...a representation, a summary of things to let the people know what you've done and... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...it's not yourself and it's not the final etched in stone... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...things...it's just another stage of it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's going on that you have to adjust and see that it's like you're sort of stirred up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I feel, I mean, actually the thing that came up just then was...just...I went to the gynecologist on Tuesday and I'd been putting it off because this is that HMO doctor and I really am not crazy about him at all. And I went because I wanted to get a pap test before...this HMO thing happens, and it was real funny because...you get up in that awkward position and say, "Oh, you have a cyst." And it's like I think it is, it's just a feeling of tremendous vulnerability at this time, of just feeling, you were saying on all fronts, and it's like that, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know and even though he said, "Oh...it's really common but we'll have to do a scraping and we may have to put you in the hospital if something turns up." It's like, "Oh, please, don't do that."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. Well, so there's a lot of vulnerability, and I feel like our ending is sort of the air, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I do, too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It might increase the sense of like...urgency. [0:54:32.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I didn't really mean to avoid that today... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...but it's there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I think there is just this heightened sense of, "Oh, my God." You know? And missing you...and just, now I was just going to skip away from that but (chuckling)... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's really part, getting that this is like the full circle and sort of getting back to what we were talking about, about the beginning and closeness and skipping away from, pulling away from and then how uncomfortable it can be... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...in that sense maybe. So we'll, let's not avoid it next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I think we should try to follow up on the work thing too, because it sounds like that's real, like you're right that, that seems like...there's a lot of good things going on but that, that seems to be aggravating everything.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So let's try to... [0:55:31.3]</p>

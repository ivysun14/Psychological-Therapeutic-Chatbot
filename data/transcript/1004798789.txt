<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good morning.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. (pause) So I got the job at the coffee shop.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. Yeah. I can kind of like join a union now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They seem very angry. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The union?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The union, yeah. (pause) I find a kind of polarization that happens every single time in every single situation. It's really frustrating. Like this, you know, it's like "Oh, unions. I'm generally in favor of unions. What are they up to?" And like there's nothing on the website about anything that might lead me to think they would ever work if they didn't have to. Like they're just really pissed off.</p>

<p>[01:06.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (voices overlapping) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like—- (pause) I just don't think that's the way to get what you want, but everybody else seems to. (pause) Also, you know, it is a big company so it's fairly anti-union. People get fired for like if people hear that they're part of the union.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or have been but, you know, lawsuits and it's—- (pause) It's a weird thing. Like on Glassdoor, out of like 1700 reviews, like 80 percent of people are pretty happy to be there. But it seems like any kind of food service where individual managers have a whole lot of power over the day-to-day lives of employees. So like—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[02:02.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's just a crap shoot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am relentlessly optimistic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many hours are you going to work?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's the thing that sucks is that they don't guarantee hours to their employees, so I told them that I needed to be working full-time. I expect that they'll want me to be working at least full-time. I expect—- if I had to guess, I think what's probably going to end up happening is they're probably going to push me to work more hours than I want to be working because that's how things usually go for me. But it could also happen that they end up not giving me enough hours. (pause) </p>

<p>[02:52.8]</p>

<p>So, you know. I'm good at that job. Like, I'm really good at that job. They're going to want to keep me. So, I don't know what to do. Just hope for the best. (pause) But, you know, doing well (inaudible at 03:21.1), to let you know, for the first time in weeks. So I'm catching up with people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Doing well enough that things could be better with James in that, you know, I'm not constantly side-lining him, like "Are you upset with me now? Are you upset with me now? Are you upset with me now?"</p>

<p>[04:01.7]</p>

<p>He was really cranky yesterday because he had allergies, and that always makes him really cranky. I don't have allergies, so I don't get it, but he also just really doesn't respond well to being sick. (chuckles) You know, he doesn't handle it well. I was able to be like well, that's him. That's not anything that I did. That's just him. (pause) Mostly. (pause) </p>

<p>[04:55.6]</p>

<p>I feel stalled this week, like I don't know what to talk about. (pause) I can think of various reasons why that might be, but I don't—- then I'll feel like trying to come up with a reason and none of them feels like they really fit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like what does come to mind?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the obvious one is like I'm scared, but it doesn't feel like that. It just feels like I don't know what to talk about, like I don't know what to say. </p>

<p>[05:56.3]</p>

<p>You've said, and I've agreed with you, that I've been more—- and I think I've said also—- that I've been more distanced from myself since James has moved here. So there's that. (pause) So maybe, plus that none of them really fits, it's feeling like it might fit doesn't actually help me, doesn't help me at all. Like it doesn't lead to change. (pause) Yeah, and it felt more than usual that I really want you to tell me what to do. (chuckles) For whatever that's worth.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. As in what to talk about?</p>

<p>[07:02.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you have in mind what I might recommend?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) It's worth a try, right? (laughter) No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just that I would sort of take charge?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) That was a hope rather than an expectation. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure. And I got the wish.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) </p>

<p>[07:56.8]</p>

<p>It's funny. I'm a very good leader actually. I never find this out until I'm in situations where I am the only person who can be the leader. But then I do a really good job. But when there is somebody else, I always default to being kind of second-in-command. I find that (inaudible at 08:26.5) (pause) Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>[09:06.5]</p>

<p>You know, I don't like to be in charge. I don't trust myself. (pause) But there's always the part of my mind that thinks I could do a better job than anybody else. (laughter) But I don't really want the responsibility. Usually. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 09:44.9) </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughter) Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was thinking also. (pause)</p>

<p>[10:32.3]</p>

<p>This is pretty scary, you know? It doesn't feel scary until it's like well, now it's time to do it, to talk and—- (pause) I don't know to what extent being afraid becomes something that is so much a part of you that you don't feel it anymore. (pause)</p>

<p>[11:25.4]</p>

<p>You know, they say you can learn to like hanging if you hang long enough. Have you heard that? It's an expression. It might be a southern thing, I don't know, or like an early 19th century thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sort of like gallows humor.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I read—- like when I was little, I read so much, like so much like early 19th and 18th century, like so much old stuff that my idea of what idioms were actually in use is still kind of off. (laughter)</p>

<p>[12:19.1]</p>

<p>On the plus side, I know how to spell them all. You know, people like—- like words that are only in idiomatic use, so people misspell them because they spell them as close to a word that is actually used today. It's called an eggcorn.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's it called?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's called an eggcorn. E-g-g-c-o-r-n.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like acorn/eggcorn, like a confusion of, that's—- I don't (inaudible at 12:57.2) (laughter) I can't think of one. (pause) Yeah. (pause) I read all the time. I miss that. (pause)</p>

<p>[13:32.3]</p>

<p>And it was a good thing, [in some ways like it]—- (pause) I got a perfect score on my verbal SATs. Missed one, so I was pissed off about that. But, you know, can't say that wasn't good for me. That was a coping skill. James asked me the other day—- he was like "You keep using 'coping mechanism' or 'defensive mechanism.' What does that mean? I don't know what these words mean." (laughter) I'm like "Well, when I use it, it usually means something that I do to keep myself from feeling so bad in the moment." And he's like "Okay." I'm like "I don't know if that's how other people use it." (pause)</p>

<p>[14:40.0]</p>

<p>Yeah, I read all the time. We had tons of books in the house, and I would just go through and steal books from other bookshelves and put them in my bookshelf. Occasionally somebody would be like "Hey, I want that book. Where is it?" and I would take it back, but not usually. So I still had lots. (chuckles) (pause) Yeah, it's funny, I can still remember some of the books I never read because I would just go through and pick them out by the covers. Like Two Years Before the Mast was one that I never read. I don't know why. (pause) But always fiction. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Always fiction?</p>

<p>[15:55.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I didn't like non-fiction. I'm still much more of a fiction person. I read the same books over and over and over again. Like I have large chunks of them memorized. (pause) I used to get in trouble for—- I would constantly have the book in my desk and be reading it under the desk during class. That was from like third grade all the way up to eighth grade. (chuckles) As long as we had desks, I would be reading under them. </p>

<p>[16:53.4]</p>

<p>Like third grade reading was so boring because we'd go around in a circle and read a sentence out loud, so it would take us like a month to get through a book. I would finish the book on the first day. Like I would just take it home and read it, and then I'd have nothing to do for basically a month. (laughter) It felt like a month. It might not have been a month. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Objectively, to a third grader, it was a month.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. And I would've been perfectly fine if they'd let me just read something else while everybody else was reading, but it was like a "We're all in this together" learning experience. I don't know. I guess learning to tolerate boredom is actually a really useful skill, but God [it was really hard to me].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: For a school-aged kid, especially.</p>

<p>[17:53.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. It just seemed like that wasn't really what I was supposed to be getting out of reading class. The ability to tolerate boredom. (pause) I'd try to take books to parties. I had to go to so many parties, and since my dad is a priest people would invite him to all the Christmas parties, so he has to go. And so we had to go. That was like a nightmare. (laughter) The period that I discovered that I actually enjoyed going to parties was, I think, when I was like okay, I guess I'm going to grow up now. (laughter) Like I don't have the impulse to hide in a room somewhere.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>[18:55.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is what I usually did. (pause) Coffee after church was the same way. Although there I guess I really didn't have to go, but there was really good food. So I was trying to get food while talking to as few people as possible. I'm really good at that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. That was the goal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) That was like the only thing people knew about me. Like "Oh, it's Tanya. She reads all the time." That was my tagline. It used to really bother me. (pause)</p>

<p>[19:59.3]</p>

<p>Like it didn't quite register that that was people trying to show interest because that was the only thing they knew about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It felt like "Well, yes, I do read all the time. I don't understand what you're saying to me." I don't know. It felt very reductive in a way. Like people who I hadn't seen for a while—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: They might be trying to reach out and to you it felt like—- so yeah, somewhat reductive.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Condescending. (pause) And the way an adult interacts with a child is not going to be condescending. I certainly experienced some adults as non-condescending, but I don't know what they were doing. Probably they were just talking to me. (laughter)</p>

<p>[21:07.7]</p>

<p>That's what I try to do with kids. (pause) Just act as if they're not kids. Or not act as if they're not kids, but just talk to them. (pause) But I don't know very many children, so it's hard to say how it works out. (pause) </p>

<p>[22:10.8]</p>

<p>I felt really desperate when I didn't have a book. Yeah. My dad would make me stop reading at the dinner table sort of thing. (pause) That was just all I did. Like all the time. (pause) That and try to be by myself because I would like climb trees and read a book there or go out in the woods and read a book there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like where you knew you could be alone.</p>

<p>[22:58.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There was like eave space in the attic in our house, and I'd read there. Probably not too safe in retrospect. Like there was exposed—- what is it—- the insulation stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I tried not to touch it. Good luck with that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That house was probably like a death trap. It was built in 1810. (chuckles) There was like asbestos everywhere. (laughter) Oh well. (laughter) In the summer, I went down into the basement which was unfinished and like—-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cooler?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, cooler. It actually had mildew, like a lot of mildew. Also not too healthy. Like the church eventually had to pay to get it renovated because somebody happened to like stop by and was like "Oh, this is actually a health hazard."</p>

<p>[24:09.3]</p>

<p>But the last thing the vestry wants to spend money on is the rectory. I mean, if you didn't know, now you do. (laughter) The last thing the vestry wants to spend money on is the rectory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The rectory, right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Most churches have moved away from having rectories anyway because then it turns into a situation like that, where you can't get stuff fixed because the vestry has to approve it. That's randomly-appointed people, so they just do a housing stipend instead. (pause) I loved that house though. I loved it. (pause)</p>

<p>[25:21.6]</p>

<p>I don't know why I never had people over, or very very rarely. Like once every two years or something would I have people over or would go over to other people's houses. Maybe not once every two years. That's probably mis-remembered. But very rarely. I don't know. (pause) Yeah, I mean, in some ways it's easy for me to see why I didn't have any friends, and in some ways it's really hard. You know, I had books so I didn't have to develop social skills. (laughter)</p>

<p>[26:24.8]</p>

<p>It made it easier for me. (pause) I suspect that I was just off, you know, in the way that some people are off. Just not in sync with social cues. (pause) But I don't know why that was. (pause) </p>

<p>[27:27.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if it was hard to bear having anyone close enough to you to see what certain things in your life were really like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I think—- and I might be wrong—- but I think it was more that I was really desperate to show other people what things in my life were like, in some ways. I mean, show peers, like people my age, and that just scared the shit out of them. Maybe. I don't know. I would always feel like my emotions were too strong for the situation or that I was coming on too strong or like I wanted to be too close, and that made people uncomfortable.</p>

<p>[28:33.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you were going to overwhelm people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So, James and I were talking about Buffy last night. (laughter) One of the things we talked about was that the adult characters in the show are really under-utilized. And that kind of led me to say that I think kids experience their lives as though other children are really important figures and adults are very much peripheral, and it's only when you get older and you look back and say "Oh yeah, the adults were really really important."</p>

<p>[29:53.7]</p>

<p>At least that's how I experienced my life. (pause) There wasn't any way for the adults to be really a part of it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, little kids could tell you that their mom and dad are really important, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, they get to an age where they really don't want that to be true.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's different from what you're talking about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Huh. Okay. I mean, I guess I was thinking more about teenagers.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Sure.</p>

<p>[30:43.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But—- (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like in Buffy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like in Buffy they're teenagers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (pause) I mean, I was talking more about teenagers last night, but I don't know that I was right now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) It felt like there was this gap that could never be bridged with my dad anyway. Like there was no way he was ever going to understand. I really thought my mom could understand things, and I really tried very hard to be close to her.</p>

<p>[31:48.9]</p>

<p>(pause) But, you know, I don't know [how much of that was] internal to me and how much was external, or internal to her and me. You know, like the hardest things for me were when my mom started smoking and when she started dating again. Like that was like devastating, both of them. Like I remember when she started dating again and I was just like "What the fuck? This is not okay."</p>

<p>[32:46.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know what made you so mad about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a man who lived in her apartment building and I didn't—- there was nothing appealing about him. To me at that age, at least. Like he wasn't somebody that I liked. But I think it was that she had a life that didn't involve me. And instead of trying harder to have a life that involved me, she was inviting other people into her life. That's how I would interpret it now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know to what extent it always felt too much like she had a life that didn't involve you?</p>

<p>[33:51.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It didn't occur to me that she had a life that didn't involve me until those two things. Like until she started dating again and until she started smoking, both of which I was about eight or so. (pause) Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Third grade.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. That was the year they took books away from me because they were too hard for me. I made them give them back, or I just found another copy. It was like Watership Down. It wasn't that the material was too racy or whatever.</p>

<p>[34:42.6]</p>

<p>Although actually when I was in sixth grade, I was reading a book that did have some pretty graphic sex scenes in it. It just never occurred to me to like try to be sneaky about reading these books. I would just read them. And a teacher—- he saw it. I think it was a Jean M. Auel book. They were so bad. (chuckles) But it was like sex and I was like "Oh, people have sex. This is fantastic." And he was like "Oh, isn't that pretty racy?" I had never heard the word racy, so I kind of didn't know what he was talking about. So I was like embarrassed but also—- because I knew that I really shouldn't be reading books that had sex scenes in them, but I also didn't want to stop reading the book and also like a librarian had recommended it to me.</p>

<p>[35:44.5]</p>

<p>She probably had just not read it. (laughter) (pause) I don't know where I was going with that. Away from third grade probably. (pause) My mom gave me Lady Chatterley's Lover when I was like in seventh or eighth grade.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She wasn't really good at the age-appropriate sexual conversations at all. When I was maybe nine, she was like "You should have sex with whoever you're going to marry before you get married because if the sex is really bad, then you're married and you're stuck."</p>

<p>[36:45.1]</p>

<p>I'm like, you know, I could put two and two together at that point. (laughter) It was like "Wow, I really didn't want to know that." (laughter) Yeah. Yeah. I think she felt she was being the cool parent by giving me Lady Chatterley's Lover, but actually I just think it's a terrible book. Like I read it then, and I think I read it again when I was in tenth grade. I just don't like D. H. Lawrence. I don't think it's that interesting. But now I'm like "What? What?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I've not read it, but just by reputation, it doesn't sound like something that you give your—- </p>

<p>[37:40.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I think it was—- yeah. (pause) You know, it's not actually—- it was not shocking to me when I read it. It was actually a little bit disappointing because it's like "Oooh, this book that's been banned" and you're just like "What? They're naming his penis. This is lame." (laughter) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It just seems silly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. You know, I get what Lawrence was trying to do, but it's like—- I don't know. It's not one of my favorites. (pause) </p>

<p>[38:41.9]</p>

<p>The only book that I read that I think was really bad for me to read when I did was Animal Farm because it made me so sad. Like I just couldn't bear for people to be this way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Tell me about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: A teacher recommended it to me. I was in fifth grade, which would make me what, 11? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: 10?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ten. And, you know, allegory about communism and like I sort of knew the background a little bit. I mean, I heard the word communism, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>[39:45.7]</p>

<p>It's pretty—- and I followed it and it just broke my heart. (pause) That it was clear that the author was like "This is what people do. This is what people are. Like this is what it means to be human." And I couldn't handle that. I really was not ready for it. (pause) I haven't ever read it again. I just won't do it. I read 1984 in twelfth grade for a class, and that was also really hard but I could handle it by that point, you know.</p>

<p>[40:55.7]</p>

<p>Like it broke my heart, but it didn't break me. (pause) You know, in some ways, that's more crushing. Have you read it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, back when I—- </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just the scene where he's like "Don't do it to me. Do it to her."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) You know, in Animal Farm, making all of the characters, all of the animals, be the agents in their own slavery.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>[41:45.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, the animals on the farm overthrow the people and establish an egalitarian society and the motto is "Four legs good. Two legs bad." Gradually over time, the pigs take over until the final scene. So it starts out as like, you know, it's basically just a classic modeling of what happens in communist societies where everything actually gets shared equally and at first things go well. And then—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some become more equal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some become more equal than others and gradually it ends up—- but everyone believes that what—- everyone who is not being duped believes that what they're doing is for the good of each other, and they don't understand why things are getting worse and worse and why they're working harder than they ever did before and getting less and less.</p>

<p>[42:47.7]</p>

<p>And in the last scene they're looking in the window at the farm, and the pigs are negotiating with the humans, and they're standing on their hind legs and you can't tell which one is which. (pause) Yeah, it's just like—- have you heard of the Game of Thrones? It's a little bit like reading that. Like I stopped after the first book of Game of Thrones because it's like everybody dies a miserable death. Some people you don't like also die a miserable death, but—- there's nothing going on other than people dying in horrible ways. Like it's not stylistically interesting, it's not—- there's nothing reductive about it.</p>

<p>[43:48.4]</p>

<p>Like he's not going for anything reductive. It's just like everything just sucks. And I can't deal with that in literature. I don't like it. (pause) Yeah, and I guess Animal Farm was the first book that I'd ever read that was really—- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [That was really that way?]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that was really that way. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah, sorry.</p>

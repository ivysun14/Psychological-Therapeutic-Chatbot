<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't (inaudible). So yeah, I did not know about (inaudible). Yeah. I don't know at all. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:00:56] to [00:01:15]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean it's up to you, we don't have to talk about it now, but whatever. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause from [00:01:26] to [00:20:56]) </p>

<p>I don't know what to say. (pause from [00:20:58] to [00:21:19]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can see that. (pause from [00:21:20] to [00:21:27]) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm trying. (pause from [00:21:28] to [00:23:34]) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How was your weekend? </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was okay. I only shopped, did ECT. It was really sad, all weekend. I did ECT, it was just really sad. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you thinking about? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I have a lot of despair. I didn't see any, anything turning out well. (pause from [00:24:48] to [00:25:23])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you see? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I had you, I know I had ECT, which sounds like it's something interesting, really wasn't. Just (inaudible from [00:26:08] to [00:26:15])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm confused, are you done with ECT now? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I'm still doing it. It's, I think they are in like a taper. So I think that we do it less often, but I'm still doing it. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:26:46] to [00:27:00]) I am, they upped the dosage the last time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Over the weekend? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You are pretty hopeless huh? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, let's be clear, I mean you are feeling pretty hopeless. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And don't see any way out of this. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I should, I just don't know what. (pause from [00:28:07] to [00:28:45]) They raised the dosage and I'm like that. That could have been...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How often do you go? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Two or three times a week. I think it's at twice a week right now basically. (pause from [00:29:26] to [00:29:53]) It's okay. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:29:54] to [00:30:13]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you don't know what to say here because you've given up? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know whether I've given up. (pause) It's certainly a possibility. (pause [00:30:41] to [00:30:57]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I hope not, but it seemed to be a possibility. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:31:01] to [00:31:20]). It does seem to me you don't really see a way out. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause from [00:31:28] to [00:33:52]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you feeling a little shut down? </p>

<p>CLIENT: A bit. I'm tired. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you feel? Did you not sleep much or? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I slept. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this earlier than you usually get up? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe, I don't know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you just aren't up. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) (pause from [00:34:44] to [00:36:18])</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you're just sad? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe I'm sad. I don't know what I am. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:36:34] to [00:38:40]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: How suicidal have you been? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Not very bad. (pause) I hate that. But yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just, do not like the, I don't know, the way I kind of latch on to despair. I just really don't like it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying it is this, I'm wondering if to you it feels sort of like a cop out or a self-indulgence or something? To latch on to despair. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It - yeah, yeah. (pause from [00:40:10] to [00:40:59]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you become close in the last few weeks? </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, not really. It's kind of staying away. </p>

<p>(pause from [00:41:14] to [00:41:34]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if this is the right way to put it, but things feel a little bit quieter. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel quieter. (pause from [00:41:46] to [00:42:31]). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, we should stop. And then we'll meet tomorrow at noon. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Call me if anything changes.</p>

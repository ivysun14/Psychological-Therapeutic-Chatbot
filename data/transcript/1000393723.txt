<p>PATIENT: (Silence) I was just thinking about how today at school I really felt more relaxed and capable, and therefore enjoyed teaching more.  And I don't know, it was just quite a change from the first 2 days.  And also the fact that yesterday — I remember when I was here, I felt differently about the reports by the end of the hour.  And then when I got home I was thinking about it, and I started to work on them.  And it just seemed clear to me that I could do them, and that I was going to be able to do them.  I'd always done them before and I just knew I was going to be able to do them again. </p>

<p>And we had, one thing I had been trying to decide what to do on was an invitation for the Saturday night uhm, during the week — that last weekend I have to work on them.  And I've always before left that weekend open, since it always seemed as if I were working constantly throughout it to get them done.  And, I don't know, this time I just decided that I'd accept the invitation and I'd somehow get them done before.  And that it would be possible.  And that I just wasn't going to make such a big thing out of them.  I don't know whether I'll continue feeling that I won't make such a big thing out of them, but I don't know, somehow I just think I know I'll get them done.</p>

<p>But then today I realized, uhm, well it was probably more toward the end of the day at school and then, whenever I thought of coming here, that this was on my mind — the fact that I had changed.  And so I knew I'd be saying something about it here.  And I just began to feel more and more nervous about talking about it, almost as if I didn't understand what had happened, but by talking about it, it might go away again or reverse itself again. (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Did you have any ideas about how to explain it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Pause) Well, I really hadn't let myself think about it, because I just wanted to enjoy feeling the way I was and not ruin it.  And I kept feeling as if thinking about it would ruin it.  And the only thing that occurred to me was it had something to do with yesterday when I was here.  But then the other thing I think of is, uh, yesterday when I went to school I really didn't feel rested at all.  And somebody asked me at school if I'd slept well the night before.  And I said, well I don't know, well, I suppose so.  But I had been sort of unaware of, or I hadn't been thinking about Monday night. </p>

<p>And then, this morning when I woke up, I was very aware of having been having a dream.  I have no idea what it was about, except that in some way it was disturbing to me.  And it was a relief not — oh, I don't know, it was almost — it wasn't even so much a relief, as I wasn't sorry to be woken from the dream.  But I didn't want to get up and I didn't feel — I, I don't know, I had sort of a vague stomach ache or something from the dream, and.  But then when I did get up — and I think this is the same thing that happened Monday night, except that when I did get up I felt differently.  </p>

<p>And I think another thing that bothers me about this whole thing that made me not want to think about it, is that it just makes me realize all the more, how I teach in a way has nothing to do with my ability, in the sense that if I'm feeling good about something, I'm not sure what except myself, then I can teach well.  And if I'm not, then I don't.  And (Sniff) it bothers me I don't have control over whatever it is, so that I can just always feel good about it and teach well.  Or feel good about whatever it is I'm doing, whether it's teaching or something else. (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You mentioned a stomach ache; does that bring anything to mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it didn't before, but when you asked, it brings to mind my feeling sometimes when MSCZ wants to have intercourse, or when we are having it.  And it also makes me think of this today when I think of it, it also makes me think of a feeling I get when — I don't know exactly how to describe it, but — I guess when I have set myself, or when I really do have to do something, or if I've just set myself a certain thing to do.  And either I'm, I don't feel I can make the decisions about it or, I don't know, in any case, I don't have confidence in myself and I don't, I'm indecisive. (Pause)</p>

<p>And it's a feeling I used to have more than I've had lately when I've been on vacation.  But it used to be true that when I was on vacation, generally I just wanted to stay at home and not, preferably not do anything, except maybe just sit home and read or that kind of thing.  And so then I'd get this feeling whenever I'd make myself go out.  Even if it were just shopping for food or shopping for other things, too.  And I'm trying to think if it happens — well, I, I, I, I mean it was almost a feeling that I would get because I wouldn't know what to do with my time except I knew I shouldn't just sit around and read all the time.  But I wanted to, so it was kind of I was fighting something in myself. (Silence)</p>

<p>And that made me think again of the dilemma I've sometimes felt over having intercourse with MSCZ.  It, and when I said that reading was something I wanted to do, but I felt I shouldn't, this particular time I thought of it that way for having intercourse too.  And MSCZ said that that's the way I feel before, but I don't know, I never, not always do I really believe it or maybe feel it.  But this particular time, it seems like that's what I'm fighting at those times, too. </p>

<p>And then after I thought that, I got that same feeling of, I don't know how else to describe it except being nervous, that I had when I first came in here, that by talking about things, I'm going to destroy the feeling I had towards school and my ability to do whatever had to be done.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's almost as if when I — oh, I don't know how to explain this either, except it did occur to me.  I, I think it occurred to me when you asked if I had any ideas about why I felt differently yesterday, and I sort of vaguely wondered if somehow I was getting back to the way I was in October before my operation.  That I have connected with feeling that I had a penis again, or somehow I was able to compete anyway.  And I've never known how exactly to take that, and whether it was a good sign or a bad sign, or just what.  And just now it seemed to me, it's almost as if when I'm thinking about acting like a female or responding in a feminine way or (Sniff) being a woman, I still don't know exactly what it means.  And somehow I begin to think just in terms of what I want, totally unconnected with any sense of responsibility. (Silence)</p>

<p>I can't seem to get that idea any clearer.  The—, I just keep thinking again of how it occurred to me because when I said that I was feeling capable now of doing at school what had to be done, or in connection with school, my thou—, I thought right after that, well, and enjoy it too, because in some ways I enjoyed today.  And then I was thinking also that I know I have to do the reports, and I don't particularly like it.  But, yet I wasn't minding it quite that much, so that when I sat down I could just do them.  And it just struck me that sometimes, I, I don't know — it's almost as if I confuse responsibilities, so then it's just something that has to be done and it can't be enjoyed.  And — (Sigh, 3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I don't know quite what to make of this, but I was sort of vaguely — well I, I, well it wasn't so vague I guess, when I thought, I don't want to lose this feeling that I have right now toward doing the reports, so I can get them done.  And it was almost as if I was then thinking I'm just not going to follow these thoughts anymore, because it might cause me to lose it.  And I don't quite know what to make of this feeling that I have that, I don't know, it's — well, that I can lose this attitude and that it would be easy to lose it.  Or it's almost as if I feel that this particular attitude is harder to have and easier to lose than the one I had before, on Monday and Tuesday. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, you know, you say it again today and you said it yesterday, that you had the idea yesterday that you wondered if you had felt better about yourself and about the school before the operation, because you had fooled yourself into thinking you had a penis.  And you allude to that again today.  Then you say you're afraid you will lose what you have.  You will lose the illusion, really is what you seem to be saying.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that would mean unless I think I have a penis, I don't have any confidence.  But then I, I don't understand how I got this illusion yesterday, so that by the time I got home I felt differently about the reports, anyway.  I didn't even — today when I was going to school I was kind of afraid I'd still feel the same way I had yesterday at school.  And then I didn't.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, it's true you don't understand, but you also make it clear that you were afraid to find out.  Because that would be equivalent to losing the illusion, what you're afraid is an illusion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, the other thing that I've kept asking about before I went into the hospital is, was the way I felt based on that illusion.  And I haven't known how to answer that, either. (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was really just thinking two things.  One was in wondering about whether or not that was the illusion that made me feel the way I did before I went in the hospital.  I then remembered that one time after I got out of the hospital when I was talking about that feeling, I think either through something you said or through questions you asked, I got the feeling that that's what you thought.  And maybe I had also that thought then, because of what other thoughts I had that day.  But since then, I haven't been able to recall whatever might have led me to also feel that way.  And I think ever since then I've always thought, well, you thought it, so it probably is right.  And I have been saying it as if I thought it. </p>

<p>But I don't know that — I mean, it just no longer really means anything to me.  Which is why, I guess, it puzzles me.  Ah, mainly I guess, because I don't understand how it happened, and what would have given me the illusion.  And I felt better than I remember, I don't know, I must have felt that way other times in my life, but I don't recall many times that I felt that confident and so forth.  And yet, it seems like other times I was trying to have that illusion.  So I don't know, I just feel very confused by it. </p>

<p>And then I, I, now I can't remember what the other thing was, except it had something to do with thinking there must be other ways — if that is how I feel confident; there must be other ways also to feel it.  Because I guess what I'm afraid of, is if I just think of myself as a woman then I'll never feel confident. (Silence)</p>

<p>When I said that, I had the feeling that I changed — even while I was here in thinking about the reports — after I had said something yesterday that had something to do with fears I have or feelings.  And it was somehow, just having faced it and said it that made me change somewhat.  But I can't remember anything I said yesterday that might have made me feel that way. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I think from what you've said that the real clue to what you wish you have, had now, what you are afraid you don't have or will lose, at the moment lies in the way you felt when you woke up this morning from a disturbing dream.  When you literally had morning sickness.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Silence) Well, it was almost a shock when you said that, because it just hadn't occurred to me consciously at all.  But then I started thinking about something that I've been thinking a lot lately, of, when I go off the pills.  I've been wondering what my reaction would be to having intercourse, and whether I'll just be so afraid that I'll start tensing up wh—, again, in a way I haven't been lately.  And I've never been too sure what I've thought I'd be afraid of, except that, I'd keep thinking well, maybe I'd just be thinking about becoming pregnant and get very nervous.  And it's almost as if I'm afraid that that's the test, and whether or not I can become pregnant, function like a woman. And that that's what I'm afraid of.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I think it's interesting that you say that you have thought about it a lot, but it hasn't come up here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, it only occurs to me — I mean by a lot, I mean — well I don't know.  I was thinking it only occurred to me when I went to bed, but then that's not true, it's occurred to me other times, too.  But I know I push that thought away. (Pause)  Because I don't, I suppose I don't want to think about it, because I don't understand why I'd have this fear that I might not be able to become pregnant and be, I suppose, truly a woman.  But then when I say that, I start thinking that I can see it, to an extent.  That if I've so many years been trying to function like a man, or compete with men or somehow, I don't know, looking toward masculine things, then it's almost as if I think also  I've lost the ability to be feminine. (Silence)</p>

<p>And I guess I was just kind of vaguely thinking of how th— if I'm neither masculine nor feminine in my eyes, then it makes me nothing.  And then I guess I was just thinking of how I keep sort of reversing and going from one extreme to the other.  No, I think I was thinking mainly just the difference between yesterday and today.  Because yesterday, I was just feeling very cold toward the boys.  I wanted absolute obedience.  And, I don't know, it was almost as if I was trying to be masculine then.  And then today, I felt much more interested in them.  And I just think I was more of a warmer and softer person all around.  I felt that way, as if I were being feminine.  And I don't know why I changed over.  And it seems like I keep — that's the switching I keep making.  (Sighs) And then I just get this feeling again I'm going to lose whatever made me feel good today, because it leaves me thinking neither is me. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you recall telling me what you thought over the weekend?  You were puzzled about why you were so angry at the idea that FNA is pregnant now, and how troubled you were by it.  And then you said it isn't as though you had tried to get pregnant and couldn't.  And now you say you are indeed worried that maybe you won't be able to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But when you say that, then it makes me think of this feeling about becoming pregnant.  Almost a fear that I won't comes out of a fear of being pregnant and a hope that I won't.  And I don't know why I fear it, except that it's a state I haven't experienced before and I don't know what it's like, and so I'm afraid of it. (Pause)  And it seems to be a combination of I won't — feeling that I won't know what to do, and I won't know what to expect.  And I am afraid of, I suppose, the ultimate giving birth as being a lack of self-control in some way, and being afraid of that.  But I'll even think in terms of I won't know what kind of underclothes to buy.  And I mean it's kind of ridiculous, but it's just all full of things I don't know yet.  And so it's almost as if I'm not really — well right now anyway, it seems that it's not so much I'm afraid I can't become pregnant, as that I might be, might be able to.</p>

<p>And I think when I heard FNA was pregnant, one thing that bothered me about it was the thought that she must have similar feelings that I have.  And how can she possibly be pregnant, if she does?  And not only pregnant, but pregnant in a foreign country where, I don't know, I, I think I just imagine it must be even harder to be pregnant there. (Silence)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

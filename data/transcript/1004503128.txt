<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Pull (ph), yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm (breathless) okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello (audible exhale). Ah (audible exhale)! Um (giggling), so made it up last weekend and having a lot of anxiety about seeing Michelle and seeing my grandpa.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I ended up (audible exhale) seeing Michelle on Friday and Friday night, [you know] (ph) spending the weekend and the beginning of the week in Kentucky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), and (pause) seeing Michelle is always good, but, it's very frustrating that we don't live in the same place, um (pause), and especially seeing her for one day is frustrating because I can just tell that she's sort of struggling. Not professionally, like good things are happening for her in her job, so that the books, she has acquired herself, are getting ready to be published, um, so that's exciting. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she has, like I got to meet her boyfriend, who was very nice.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm, oh good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But she's always testing people, like acting out and creating awkward situations so that people can still like stick by her and she'll know she's loved.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible exhale) I always keep hoping she'll grow the fuck (other chuckling) out of this, and she never does (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hasn't (ph) yet?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No (slight giggle)! Um (pause), and like there are just certain things she says that make it clear that there are certain tangles in her brain that she just can't seem to work out and is frustrated with. And, (pause) um, I'm looking forward to going and actually spending time with her so we can have some longer conversations, (audible breath) um, because I don't think, I don't think she is writing in her journal very much or just not really (pause) trying to work through things that would probably benefit her (slight chuckle) to work through (audible exhale).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), and I just get frustrated and sort of think her stagnate. And I know it's, it's hard because (audible breath) her job is very demanding and takes up most of her time and energy (pause) [but it'd be] (ph) nice to see more of her you know. [00:02:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she wants to write a novel, too, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and I think it's going to be hard for her when she still has some, (pause) with some of the hang-ups she has, like that we've talked about in the past, um, [worthless writing and the mixed mess I think follows] (ph), so (pause/audible breath) it just sucks because I think we could benefit each other a lot (chuckling exhale), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . but.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . if you could see each other more?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh well, uh-huh, (pause) so I saw her (audible breath) and then I went to see my grandparents (audible exhale), and [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it otherwise helpful to you to see her? It was frustrating?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't even [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it also helpful or not really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's always [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . good being in her presence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just like her, her energy in hearing her turn up her [muse again] (ph) and seeing her facial expressions just makes me very comfortable, (audible breath/pause) um, and just reminds me of (pause) something that I still sort of have in my life, if in a much smaller dose than I would appreciate (giggling). [00:03:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so it usus-, there was only one time when it really wasn't good seeing her and that was because she was just so (pause) difficult (chuckling), sort of, um (pause), she had put up big walls and was also really acting out (audible inhale) and (audible exhale) [without a doubt] (ph) she was frustrating, but, but usually [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . it's good seeing her for a day (giggling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), so then Saturday, got to Kentucky early in the morning, (audible breath) um (pause), and my grandma has been having sort of a decline in health; that is slow decline. She has Alzheimer's, so she's losing her memory, um, especially of short-term things; you know she remembers up to a (pause) pretty recent point. [00:04:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, my dad's mom had Alzheimer's, such that she didn't remember who I was [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . or my mom was, and that was rough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It made it hard to visit, when every hour we'd have to be reintroduced.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and it just seems like disorienting for everyone involved, and I wasn't, we weren't sure if it really did much good for us to visit since it sort of confused her and like reminded her (audible breath) that she had [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . this problem, and that made us sort of, me and my mom anyway, stop really visiting very much; we weren't sure if it was just on account of her (slight chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but you know my grandma remembers that, that I'm an adult and so it's nice having (audible breath/pause) this basis on which to interact. Like she may not remember that I came the day before, since I am seeing her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes she'll remember that I've been here and sometimes she'll say, "Oh, when did you get here?" [00:05:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's getting much easier to explain that [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Exactly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . than to explain (both chuckling) who I am.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or that you're not in junior high.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling sigh).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: How did I get so tall (chuckling)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um (pause), but you know I saw (pause) my grandpa and it was (pause) just difficult to see him in such bad health, because he's always been very active, (audible breath) and I've never really seen him, um (pause), you know really unable to move, unable to walk around, (pause) and that's so uncharacteristic, 'cause (pause) I always brag to people about how he still does woodworking and builds tables and (audible breath) you know still is involved in his business, even though he's 87 (pause) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and he is very proud of that you know. And he wakes up every night and reads from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. and he reads health and science journals and health and science books. [00:06:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When does he sleep?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He gets like a nap in the early night and (pause) then maybe a little nap in the early morning; he doesn't sleep much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess not.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), and so his life is so characterized by this vitality and by he's like involved in the church. He was supposed to actually be a guest preacher the day [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . he had his heart attack (pause), um, and it was so devastating for him to be like brought low in that sense. And (audible breath/pause) I mean his whole (pause) point for living is like taking care of Grandma and keeping up with these (chuckling exhale), these things with the church and with his activities [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and even his learning, (audible breath) and (pause) he wasn't able to do any of those things when he was sick in a hospital bed. And (pause) he is going to have a hard time being mobile, at least for a while, if he recovers, um (pause/audible breath), and I know that was pretty hard to see. [00:07:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How are his spirits?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible breath) Well, he, I think at first he was doing a little better, (audible breath) but then Grandma collapsed, and well we were in the room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And luckily we were you know in the hospital already (pause),</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . so we had her (pause) taken to the emergency room, (pause) um, and they did a bunch of tests then (audible sigh/sniffing/pause). (Others in background making various noises) Hmm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No idea.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's probably people being silly rather than people (other chuckling) being murdered (chuckling), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I would think and hope, since it's broad daylight (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), but they ran a bunch of tests and didn't find anything wrong with her (pause), but her general mental state and memory was much worse after she collapsed, (audible breath) so we sort of worry that she had another stroke (audible breath) because her response to that was similar to the response to a stroke. [00:08:11]</p>

<p>Um (pause), and seeing her in such bad shape really (pause) made it harder for him, since (pause) he always had like (audible breath) you know getting back up and taking care of her to sort of keep him going, but (pause) he and everyone else is really worried that she might not have [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . very long with us, (pause) um, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh!</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . so he was in much worse spirits I mean after that. And (audible exhale/pause) I felt that (pause) the whole time I was there, like a pretty ineffective hospital visitor. And I knew that the most important thing was to be there, and like just to hang out, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . to him, but everyone else seems (chuckling breath) to know helpful things to do. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>And (pause) I mean they had been a lot, there longer that I had but I, I felt somehow like (pause) these other people who had siblings, had been more involved in family life, just had these instincts that I just don't have (huffing chuckle) and I felt sort of useless. Um (pause), and then talking to him (pause), you know we can talk about the hospital and about Grandma and I can sort of ask him questions and he could say he was listening to me. (Audible breath) But when I would try to think of more conversations to have, it was really frustrating how difficult it was. Because I would think of the things that I would usually say to Jeff or my friends "oh, I read a book about blah, blah, blah" (audible breath) but I don't think he'd really be interested in these like immoral, heathen books that I read (chuckling breath).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or "I saw this or that movie" or (audible exhale) "I was thinking about this and that artistic or literary concept (nervous chuckle)" or "I saw this or that friend that you don't" [overlapping voices] [00:10:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ". . . know" (audible exhale).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All of the things that I would usually say just seemed sort of invalid and hollow in that context, and it was a very strange feeling having nothing to say to someone who means so much to me. [Silence from [00:10:16] to 00:10:26] Um (pause), and it made me feel like something was really like lacking in me that I couldn't come up with conversation topics, you know things to talk about with my own grandpa (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [Silence from [00:10:39] to 00:10:48] Yeah, I would think that was quite disturbing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:11:00]</p>

<p>And since I was sitting by his bedside, you know like sitting there quietly and sort of responding when he would say something or like getting him some water when he wanted it, was you know certainly better than nothing (pause), but it seems like I could've done a lot better than I did (other huffily chuckling). And (pause) I don't know, it just made me wonder, like (audible exhale/pause) is there really such a huge gap between the way I experience life and the way he does that (pause) we can't (pause) have very many conversations or very long conversations? It seems like life should be much more universal than that (huffing chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [Silence from [00:11:42] to 00:11:53] Well and it's not just somebody off the street, as you say, it's your grandfather, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . somebody who's very important to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [Silence from [00:12:00] to 00:12:16] Yeah, I mean there were some obvious topics (pause), you know Jeff, Seth and cousins, so I could say "oh, so and so is looking very well".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "So and so seems very happy with her husband" (huffing chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so really I don't know, it sort of runs out quick, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . because you don't want to start like talking shit about your family (other chuckling), and that's the kind of conversation that could really like go on and on (both chuckling), not the conversations about people being happy (other chuckling); there's not much to [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . say about happiness (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Huffing chuckle) hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right, there are famous quotations aren't there about there being no normal (ph) about happy people or something like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (huffing chuckle). Um (pause), yeah and I think Tolstoy said "every happy family is the same, but every unhappy family is" [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible] [00:13:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ". . . unhappy in a different way" (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: [I know] (ph). [Silence from [00:13:12] to 00:13:17] Yeah, um (pause), yeah, so I sort of felt very (pause) inadequate there and (pause), and I think this is part of why I haven't, uh (pause), told them I'm not religious, because that's something they talk about a lot and if they felt like they couldn't discuss that with me (emphasis) I think they would feel what I'm feeling much more and I don't want, (pause) I don't want the feeling to be mutual (huffing chuckle), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . more than it already is (huffing giggle). Um (pause), and living with the kind of anecdotes I tell, like (pause) they're not very, (pause) uh, consistent with a Christian outlook (giggling) (sniffing, huffing chuckle). [00:14:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what they'll (ph) think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh (pause), well like I was just racking my brain for things that had happened recently that were interesting. I was like "well, like Sue is dating three guys right now (both chuckling) trying to figure out which one she likes" (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like well but that's not really something that (both chuckling) would impress them. Um (pause), I don't know. I mean it's not like they go around like acting immoral all the time, so it's not like they would think it was really that bad. But I guess the things that I sort of flag as interesting or just really are funny (pause) tend not to be the virtuous things (slight chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know about this, but I'm wondering if there's something like a bond there, in that I mean there are topics that occur to me about your life that you know like they could be reasonable to talk about. I mean such as like your road trip with your dad. [00:15:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or I don't know, about maybe your new job, although that gets into like not being in school and I don't know if you wanted to bring that up, but certainly your new job.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I did talk about that (slight chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a good one (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . the time home with your parents and what that was like. Or I mean could you talk about stuff like what your classmates are studying or what people are reading about or things like that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I wonder how I just said they'll be on a topic, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . beyond sort of a factual statement. Like when I think about how would I talk about my time home? Like well I spent a lot of time reading and a lot of time writing and a lot of time thinking, and then I think about each of those activities and whether they would be interested in any of them and whether I would be interested in sharing my thoughts on them (questioningly). [00:16:03]</p>

<p>I definitely wouldn't want to really discuss the time I spend writing and thinking, so that leaves the reading, just like what they mean, just that in these contemporary, fiction-like novels I read or in this book about interpreting poetry that I read, like what would they really want to hear about those things? And maybe there's more [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well why wouldn't they just be interested in like that, in a lot of ways, you're happy to be home? That it was nice to have a break from being around Hanover, that you know throw in something about it being nice to see your parents, which you know I'm sure it was sometimes, and that would be nice for them to hear, even if it wasn't all the time (slight chuckle). You know what I mean like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . maybe a break and what it was like to be back where you grew up. I don't know, like I guess what I'm trying to assess out here is I guess it seems like maybe there's something going on with that. Like maybe there's something that gets in the way of it, of your being able to think about topics you could talk about that would appeal. [00:17:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like maybe those things that, like I have so much anxiety about being unable to relate to them that sort of block my vision of the [full batch] (ph)?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe, or you feel guilty for not still doing some of the things that you know matters so much to them, and so it makes you think of all the things you're like "doing wrong"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's possible. [Silence, except for a sigh, from [00:17:40] to 00:17:53]</p>

<p>Yeah and I think I'm also a little bit (pause) anxious about sort of the, the wide appeal of the things that I do, that I'm pursuing intellectually and that I do in my life, like in the sense in which I feel self-conscious that maybe I have been sort of elitist, too, that, um, could use a little like down-to-earth sense or something, but (both chuckling) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do you mean that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, just trying to imagine, like talking about the reading I'm doing and the thoughts I'm having about it, just seems like it appeals to such a small crowd of people and that's sort of a criticism upon the type of thinking I'm doing. And I don't necessarily care that much 'cause I think it's really ridiculous when people expect (audible breath) your pursuits to have a universal appeal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But on the other hand, like maybe it's sort of bad if you haven't found an angle that would appeal to at least your relatives (huffing chuckle). [00:19:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess, to me, it doesn't, I'm not sure if I don't understand what would appeal to your relatives (slight chuckle) or, again, there's something getting in the way. But like, yes, I can understand how describing various schools of thought and literary theory would probably not appeal. But I'd imagine with some of the stuff that you're reading there are things you could talk about or things they'd be eager to hear about that interested you. You know I don't know exactly what you've been reading but I mean it's not all like obscure theory stuff, it's some of this, I don't know, fiction that's like maybe not on the best seller list but not that fringy or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And so then, I don't know, what do you think? [00:20:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I had some luck with that [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . with my dad, but he really doesn't care about intellectual thoughts and aesthetic theory.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he doesn't have the background in it [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . that I do, but he has sort of more of an interest in that direction [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . so was able to talk about my reading with him [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and feel like he was interested and like we both enjoyed the conversation.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, my relatives tend to read things so they can feel, like inspirational, true-to-life stories [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . or things with religious undertones [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . or totally like silly mystery novels.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Really, really sentimental, like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. That's sort of like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . Nicholas Sparks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . like humanity's aspect of things. It's not really, like they're probably not sort of so into the humanistic aspect of various sorts of culture. [00:21:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, and that's the very aspect that interests me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I just question whether they would see value in the kind of studies I do and the things I'm interested in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (sighing), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it also doesn't feel like they would be into it just because it matters to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I mean I guess there's a certain like entertainment value in seeing someone you care about talk about something they're interested in (questioningly).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if they would care like what I was saying necessarily (sniffing/chuckling). That they would probably be like "oh, well she sounds really interested in that, that's great" and I, but [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I don't know if that's [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess it's not [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . a conversation that really [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: . . . the kind of thing you really want, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, also, a lot of the books I've been reading, um, in the last, you know since August, are sort of about really dysfunctional people doing dysfunctional things (huffing chuckle). [00:22:00]</p>

<p>And, theoretically, I could you know think about the reading I did like eight months ago and, but, um (pause). You know I just read a book by Michelle Lubeck (sp) about an artist, um, who's going through like all these different phases of his career, and how he's drawn to different types of photography and painting. And then he actually calls up the writer, Michelle Lubeck, you know he becomes a character in his own book, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and it's pretty hilarious, like these stages they have about [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . aesthetic representation (other chuckling). And then the writer, Michelle Lubeck, is like really gruesomely murdered (both chuckling), and like how they just stripped, in this like imitation Jackson Pollack painting, all over the floor (both chuckling). And, um, you know it sort of takes you into wondering whether the artist did it, and it makes you feel a little guilty 'cause someone else did it (chuckling). [00:23:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I mean it's, it's so meta (ph), it's so [about a] (ph) representation, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . I was like what, what could I say to them about this book that they would value and be interested in (sniffing)? Um, and, and asking those questions makes me very anxious about (huffing chuckle) you know like whether what I am saying about it is really that valuable (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And sometimes they might be right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And that maybe I should be thinking a lot harder and deeper and questioning what I'm doing on a much more sentimental level (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm, well tyrants (ph) are different from a lot of your family.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and then, then I found this out when I got back, this is a whole, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:24:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . even another level of (huffing chuckle) strangeness, I was talking to my cousin Angie, who's a junior in high school, and [inaudible], she's the daughter of my cousin who we thought committed suicide but turned out was almost certainly murdered by his heroin dealers, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . um (pause), and she's a very good musician and it looks like has been accepted to a performing arts school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So she's his daughter?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and her mother is very sweet and functional. Um, so you know she was at the hospital, too, and I was talking to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) you know she said she read Madame Bovary and hated it because she just hated the character. So I was trying to talk to her about like reading through things other than character and reading for sort of perspective and for that voice and that particular way of seeing the world. And you know it was interesting, it was like fun talking [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . with her about literature. And then we all, you know most of the family, accept for a few people who were like helping Grandma and Grandpa, went to see her act in a play and she was very good. [00:25:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), and then when I got back, my mom called me and said that she had taken a bunch of pills [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God!</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . in a sort of half-hearted suicide attempt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my God!</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just, I couldn't believe it (frustrated chuckle) [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa!</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . 'cause I just had seen her a couple of days ago and she was, she didn't seem happy but she seemed sort of fine and engaged [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow!</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and excited about college. And evidently, like she wasn't trying very hard, like she didn't take that many pills and then she called her friends to say she'd taken a bunch of pills, so it didn't sound like she really wanted to actually die, she just sort of was really frustrated and wanted to do something about it. [00:26:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Clearly there are some things not right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And (audible exhale) I just didn't know how to process that. And I don't know if I'm supposed to know that she did that, because I was thinking of what kind of like maybe e-mail or note I should send her saying something useful or — I mean when we were at the hospital together she like, she was telling me about some of the drama she was dealing with in high school, and I was saying, "Oh, you know you're someone who's really going to love college. Like trust me, your life is going to get so much better in eighteen months".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So (audible breath) I mean (audible exhale) in normal circumstances I would say something like that, but I already did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's like (audible exhale) what do I say, what do I say to her? I don't know (frustrated chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [All right] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe (pause), well who knows (frustrated chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are your thoughts? [00:26:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), I was wondering if there was some book or a book of pictures by a certain artist that I thought she might enjoy, not that she like needs a book to read right now, maybe poetry because you can just flip through that. I was just trying to think if there was anything that might, since I already gave her like, without knowing she was having suicidal thoughts, I sort of gave her my rational argument for like why things were going to be great (huffing chuckle), so maybe there's some, some poet or artist who she could just glance at and get inspiration or something (ph).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think she'd want to talk to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. I mean I, I think (pause), theoretically, talking to me could be helpful, since you know I've been going through a sort of rough time, but she doesn't know that so she might not think talking to me would be helpful (frustrated chuckle). [00:27:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just thinking like, I don't know how, I don't have a sense of how close you are, but you know you're her older cousin and you're not somebody of your parents' generation but you're somebody who's a little older than her you know, and I don't know if she has like older siblings or whatever, but.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Well I mean she has older friends who are already at college. Yeah, I guess I could (pause) see if she wants to talk. But I was just so surprised.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you want to talk to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If she wanted to [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right, [all right then] (ph).</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . talk to me I would. I wouldn't, I just worry about being sort of presumptuous and seem, trying to seem like I have all this wisdom or something like that. But if I can (laughing) hedge (ph) it to a book in that (other chuckling), I can, um, I mean I don't think I would, once we were actually talking, but in proposing talking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can assure, you don't always have to be so wise listening to people, I promise (both chuckling). [00:28:57]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible breath) Oh man. Yeah, I guess it's worth, worth trying. But, ah, the visit just gave me so much to digest. Um, and at the very end, when I had to leave, I, I wished I had stayed longer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When did you get back?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Monday night, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . late, late at night. Um (pause), but when I was saying goodbye to my grandpa, he actually started crying. And I think, you know he said "you know Grandma just may not be around that much longer" and I think that's why he was so overcome, like he was thinking, as I left, that that might be the last time I would see Grandma, and you know I was pretty overcome by that thought, too. And I want to visit again soon so that that's not the case, but I mean things are so uncertain with them. I just, ah (audible exhale), facing someone realizing that is just, and someone I care about, is pretty overwhelming. [00:30:06]</p>

<p>(Audible breath) And when I was leaving he said "now I want you to read 'The Desire of Ages' by Ellen White", which is a book by this woman, who used to be considered sort of a prophetess of our sect of you know Jehovah's Witnesses and is now considered more of a very good religious thinker, who Jehovah's Witnesses are supposed to read. Um (pause), and he said "you know I want you to read this book because it'll change" and he paused then "it'll change the way you think about everything".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I wondered, when he was saying that, like has he figured out that I'm not a Christian?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible exhale) Is he sort of in denial about it or does he just want me to read this book (audible exhale)? I don't know. [00:30:59]</p>

<p>He, he (audible exhale/pause) has a book that he's written, ten pages long, about his own experience with Christianity. It starts out with entertaining stories from when he was in the Navy and then gets more into his, like his idiosyncratic interpretation of religion [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and he carries copies of it wherever he goes. And he says he, whenever he meets a new person, even the clerk at the grocery store, clerk at Home Depot, whatever, he tries to get a sense for whether they're interested in spiritual things and, if they are, he talks to them about his book and gives them a copy. And he says he can always tell when someone is interested.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (sniffing) you know, when he was saying this to me and Jeff, so I mean Jeff said to me, "Oh, I hope, I hope he didn't take one look at me and say 'oh, he's not interested in spiritual things'" (both chuckling). And you know I was thinking the exact same thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:31:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he is so concerned with the way people act and body language and tone of voice, as a manifestation of spiritual attitude, (sniffing) has he figured me out (chuckling), [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . um (pause), and, and so he's asked me to read this book? And I said I would, because how can you say "no" to your grandpa on a hospital table.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But having said "yes", now I feel like I really should read it; it's 400 pages long (huffing chuckle). It's a 400-page book about a particular type of Christianity. But I should read it because if it's, there's the question of what I'll say to him about it (huffing chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and she talks about, about health and things like that, and in 400 pages I'm guessing she gets into how people should treat each other and more sort of general topics. Um (pause), and so I was thinking well maybe if I read it I can just make notes of everything that doesn't have to do with God and say to him "oh, I thought this passage was really great, and that and that" (chuckling). [00:33:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know (barely audible) whether that's sort of an honest response. It's not dishonest, it's a little misleading but. [Silence from [00:33:27] to 00:33:58]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well they're putting you, I think, in a very difficult position. I mean my impression is that the message is something like "we will only think about you in the same way" and I don't know if it feels like they'll only love you "if you're like this".</p>

<p>CLIENT: I definitely don't get the sense that they'll only love me, I just think they, they'll never doubt that they are wrong about God.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so they really want me to see the light. So it's not sort of structured like an ultimatum, it's just structured like this truth that they suspect I may not fully understand, that they really want me to understand because they care about me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now I think I follow, but [Silence from [00:34:57] to 00:35:09] their connection doesn't really leave room for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And something I wonder is like how much room there is for me in that. And maybe that's one reason I have trouble talking to them, is I, I just, yeah, I wonder how interested they are in secular things, um, and things that aren't structured in a moral way, and (huffing exhale) I'm not sure (chuckling/sniffing).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm. I guess it gives me a piece of it that, [silence from [00:35:47] to 00:35:55] that it gives me, like you don't mention but sounds important. To me, the only thing that's wrong is the difficulty of your position. I mean your focus is on finding ways to connect with them, in spite of the differences in your beliefs, right? [00:36:17]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But there is a way, I think, that they are doing this to you. You're not doing this to them, they're doing this to you and it makes it very difficult for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not at all saying that they're bad or they (other chuckling) need to do something hurtful, clearly the opposite.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think they're doing this to you and I don't think there is anything you can do about it. I mean you know there are ways you can handle this, (other chuckling) what you're sort of saying (ph) a lot about, but you didn't set it; they set it up this way, you didn't. [00:37:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I just want to be clear, like my emphasis here is on what I imagine is, I think, your discomfort with like your inherent like passivity in this situation.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't mean to be emphasizing like that they should be different and that it's their faith that's a problem, like that's not what I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm more trying to say like I think they put you in sort of a tight corner. [00:38:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I think you're reacting to it but I don't think you quite see it that way. I imagine partly because you don't want to think about them doing that to you or probably because you don't want to feel like you're in a tight corner like (other chuckling) that, although it seems pretty clear that you kind of are (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and so definitely (both chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I guess I'm very unwilling to see them in a negative light 'cause I just know that they mean so well (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I understand, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I think it's like that with faith, right, like they're just trying to do the most helpful possible thing they can imagine. [00:38:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And living where they do, they don't really encounter many non-believers, so they haven't been forced to cultivate sort of a tolerance and I mean neutrality around the subject of faith. (Audible breath) Because I think, um, you know when I was dating Seth, my grandparents both said "oh," like you know "I, I had this doctor who was Jewish and we had really interesting talks about faith and like interpretations of the Old Testament", but it was always like an exemplary thing, it wasn't like, "Oh we've known lots of people who weren't Christian."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like "oh, I have this example" of you know the situation "that proves we can get along great" (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah (chuckling).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . and (pause), and so it's not sort of, I mean it's something they can, they can do, but it isn't just their general assumption and the way that it is in Los Angeles or New York, where you just never know what someone believes [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . when you meet them, well for the first time, like who knows (slight chuckle). [00:40:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. What's your concern about thinking badly of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), really just that I love them and think they are very well intentioned and they don't deserve to be thought badly of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are the bad thoughts you would have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, sort of (audible exhale) not blaming them on any like intentional level, but just sort of wishing maybe they had been exposed to a wider variety of types of people, um, so they weren't so, (pause) uh, sure in the rightness of their faith (huffing chuckle). Because that's just a sort of stifling social environment, when you're clearly the odd one out or not clear, hopefully not clearly, hopefully I have made that pretty unclear (both chuckling) [that I've been] (ph) trying. [00:41:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, but, but being the, knowing that you're the odd one out is, it's a little difficult [I guess] (ph) (whispering).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: M-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they all went to the same college, which is not only a Christian college but a Secular college. Um, and one of my cousins has been having a really hard time finding a guy today because she, not only wants to date a Christian but a Witness, and in like rural Kentucky you're only going to find so many Jehovah's Witnesses guys of a certain age, not with whom she can [feel on] (ph) with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, I mean that particular faith is very important so, at so many levels [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . removed from, um, just a naturally sort of open-minded attitude about faith and different approaches.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Audible breath) [Silence from [00:41:56] to 00:42:03] And I felt really guilty, because when I agreed to read that book, "The Desire of Ages", at first, I was just thinking, I thought it was probably like not very long, like well I'll get this over with and I'll find some passages to say I liked.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then when I saw it was 400 pages, oh no, like there are so many things I want to be reading and that I know I'll get a lot out of. And then I had this horrible thought (huffing chuckle), which was like, well maybe I could read it and like you know write about my reactions while I'm reading it in like sort of the form of a personal essayist and practice my skills as a personal essayist and get something out of it in that way for myself (audible inhale), which (audible exhaling chuckle) I sort of, I mean this is why trying to be an artist kind of makes you an asshole sometimes (chuckling), is because you're always trying to bring your own, like express yourself in every situation. [00:43:04]</p>

<p>This is something I'm doing, not to be selfish but because my grandpa wants me to do it, and here I'm turning it into this selfish, self-centered enterprise that has nothing to do with (chuckling) you know why he wants me to read it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [Silence from [00:43:19] to 00:43:32] Well but it sounds like that's partly because you can think of no other way to like honestly bring yourself to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I could just speed read the whole thing (audible inhale), but (audible exhale/inhale), but instead I seem to want to turn it into a learning experience for me in my secular, self-centered (huffing chuckle) writing (both chuckling). [inaudible] [00:44:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [Or at least feeling maybe] (ph) a little guilty (laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). Yeah, I mean it just draws attention to the self-centeredness (chuckling), with the other writing I'm doing, that that's my first instinct of you know like being expected to read this religious book, (pause) and that I like need so badly to assert myself (huffing chuckle).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah and I get that (slight chuckle). [Silence from [00:44:27] to 00:44:34] An alternative way to look at it, again, not to the point of trying to criticize your grandfather but only to — but you could say he, in the situation where you couldn't possibly say "no", like foisted this book, 400-page book on you, when you have a lot of other stuff going on in your life, and you dared to have the thought that you could write honestly about your reactions to it and then feel, not only horrible and selfish for entertaining that idea but as though it reflects badly on your interests, in general (other huffily chuckling). I think you're in a tight spot. [00:45:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (huffing chuckle) uh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay (audible exhale and breath).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sounds good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll see you next week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you find anything about the insurance, by the way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I haven't found out, [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . at this end, anything yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll let you know [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: . . . when that's all sorted (chuckling) out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, no problem. I guess just let me (chuckling) know if there's anybody to bill, otherwise like [overlapping voices]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well have a good week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:46:00]</p>

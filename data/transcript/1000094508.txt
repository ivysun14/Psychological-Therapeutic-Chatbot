<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ready to go?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. How about you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good question.</p>

<p>PATIENT: A little tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has been a busy day. I will probably be giggling tonight.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah man probably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You look like you are kind of not sure if you are feeling up to this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is a nice way of putting it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is going on? [0:01:01.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I am kind of basically at the beginning of this week I was down in the dumps as I could possibly be and close to being suicidal. Last night I basically, I started this sort of dental appointment with Cynthia. Ended up, basically with me spending the night with her or her spending the night with me which where does that put us anyway. Where does that put all of us? Where does that I mean there is not a soul on the planet that would not say this about anybody but Cynthia is one of the greatest fucking things you can do with an evening.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you are feeling better because of that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Talk about the power of Cynthia yeah sure. I am not so sure it is [0:02:03.9] what I should be doing. I am not so sure that I should be getting still on one hand and I can tell you there is no way to say that that was a bad time. I do not. I had a great time. It was nice to see her. It was not nice to see her when it started and I just really wanted to keep it to about 15 minutes. I was joking with lots of people about wearing a wire and having chains of psychologists nearby if I whispered the secret word there would be a huge intervention pressing her to the ground. I should quit saying that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What? [0:03:01.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is nice of you not to point out that I was joking. Even though I was.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was really half joking.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is this embarrassing to tell me about this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. I guess.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am stuck with the fact that first there is just no way of getting around it emotionally and physically it was really satisfying on some level.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you feel better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I do. I mean sure. I mean part of me just does not feel [0:03:59.6]</p>

<p>like being analytical about it. And this is sort of funny. Part of me is just thinking that this is exactly what I said would happen all along. It is, of course, perfectly nears my progress "in here" kind of thing. To break up with Jim and come back or to break up with Cynthia and to come back. It is just like what is going on. Whatever happened to this good old fashioned thinking and acting on those thoughts and dreams. Just sort of I am in therapy</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you did that last and you do not want to beat it up too much. You do not want to run over it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well last night when you saw Cynthia.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I was thinking quite the opposite. I was thinking of and part [0:05:02.3] of me I am just tired of agonizing over every little thing but actually your point I think was the opposite. I remember, I feel like basically I stand a strong chance of repeating kind of because I am in a very difficult period. I do not know, closer and we said all these things, and I do not know part of it just goes against my better instincts. It is a fucking problem. I have sort of a long tradition of just cleaning house and saying to hell with all of this and not getting fully obsessed with some relationship and as [0:06:10.7] you have been witness to our whole relationship is just like the with Cynthia and I (inaudible at 0:06:18.0) interesting fun sometimes frustrating sometimes. Short term for sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you make of this pattern you are pointing out?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My instinct is to be self critical, but I should have just dumped both of you and Cynthia long ago although I have to now be getting wonderful pain from both of you. Ultimately, I am probably going to like that forever historically.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see it almost exactly the reverse in a way. In the sense, that it seems to me your instinct is what you follow when you do not care. It is like that is what you wanted to do and that self criticism is something you tell yourself. I should not be doing this. What the hell am I doing? Along those lines. I am opening, as you said, the door for another very difficult period with her and then with me and I do not know if that parallel applies with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So as they say in the fairy princess bride here, we are at an impasse.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you have had an interesting last few sessions and I kind of do not know what to talk about. Because it has been my feeling. I have been feeling in the last couple of sessions, pretty roundly criticized and often finding myself feeling like I would like to get defensive and trying not to be defensive. That is really what I catch myself.</p>

<p>Trying not to be defensive. I wonder if you have had any awareness of that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Of course. I told him that you were critical I still think there was validity in the points that I was making. I do not know. I think you, whether or not you get defensive or not, why do you want to talk about that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because I think it is important. I think it is something, yeah,</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why do you think it is important?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well for one thing I think it is as you said that you are aware of. We are both aware of, but has not been quite articulated yet. It seems to me Dylan a big shift from before. Not a big shift, I think it was always kind of lurking in the [0:10:02.8] background. Not a big shift in that sense. Well maybe that is why we need to talk about it. Maybe it does seem like a big shift to me and I am not sure that it does to you. It seemed to me for some sessions that you had been fairly positive about what was going on. Yes you were struggling with not being able to talk about what you wanted to talk about but it said some good things about the therapy and liked some of my comments. This was, these last couple of sessions did seem different to me. Do you see it the same way? I am kind of pausing to see if you agree. I am wondering if you see it like that or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh I do. It seems so obvious that I cannot believe you raising it as a question.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see now I could take that as very critical too. [0:11:00.2]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I have said, I am again, that one thing that I find very odd is that I will say something and then you will ask me a question that basically repeats what I just said. I said I have in the past two weeks. You bet ya, it was different. I felt like I was not getting support from you and I felt like I went out on a limb to sort of try and increase my trust in you and what was going on here. I bumped it up a notch and you stayed not necessarily, I thought you stayed in a kind of defensive mode and we were having a quarter of a session about you and it was the same session where I had been [0:12:04.7] disclosing about being slightly sweet on Maria and stuff like that. I was just like and then I had essentially within every ten days I have had two and a half or three days of severe disorientation. Right</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Before getting to that I think that what you were saying before that, I do not mean to cut you off, I do want to mention this because I think it is important because I think that is what we need to talk about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Which?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part about not just the obvious part yeah you said you were going to be critical and you had reasons for being critical but it seems to me, I have a sense that there is more to it than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More to it than the reasons I have already given? First of all I would like to know what reasons you remember me giving and personally I would like to [0:13:06.0] know what you are giving me reasons already. If you are saying there is more to it then you have lost quite a sense of what there is more. What the base point is. I have already told you some of the reasons I was angry and being critical so now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's stop for just a second because I feel like I get the feeling that we are rehashing this. That we have already done this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah. I do. I mostly feel like we are going down another path that all of the sudden is you are feeling defensive so you want to process that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh Huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is like maybe you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is about me and it is not</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is going to be about you and basically even though ok, you [0:14:05.0]</p>

<p>just told me that I do not get it and there are some good things going on and this has been the second with this upspokable bad feeling sort of emerge. I have lost the train of my thought here. I know that this feels like you sort of repeating. This is going to be about you. I do not know what else to say. [0:15:04.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me see if I can. I have like we have talked about this and you have given reasons. I am just it seems to be to still be here in the room with us in a sense, this tension. I want to talk about it. It is not easy to talk about. I am not finding it easy to talk about. I am sorry I just did not hear what you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I said talk about it then I</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me see if I can ask it another way. I see what you mean. I think there is something about the way that I worded that that I did not intend that to sound like I was talking about me. Let's see if we can broach the subject a little bit [0:16:01.3]</p>

<p>differently. That one session, the session in which the first half, as you said, tried to raise the level of trust and you talked to me about things that were difficult to talk about and the second half you felt like I became defensive and I talked about stuff that was about me. You made it very clear to me in the last couple of sessions that you were very critical of that. I understand that. Even then, it seemed that the strength of your reaction to that surprised me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I guess that is why, that is part of the reason why that I had this sense that maybe there was even more to it that you and I had had a chance to talk about yet.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably. [0:17:02.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I do not know what. I am kind of wondering if we can hypothesize about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well wait a minute. I told you that there was a context. I told you that you were not the reason for all of this happening, there was an arrogant welcome and that was in this room that I said that. That you had, that you were not the cause of it but you were sort of the last thing that pushed sort of me over the edge and so invariably it is unfair to bring all this baggage back to you and on the other hand you are the officer [0:18:01.5] on deck and you are the only person in my life right now that has special training for helping negotiate all other arenas like psychological and all that or helping me negotiate those things or at least dealing with me and everyone else when negotiating or however you want to put it ok. So I was angry and I had to be very clear about the fact that I was feeling some unmet needs here and so you can call that criticism if you want or you can call that defensiveness but the strength of the critique was also the strength of the frustration. I even went so far as to go back and say I felt like those needs had been going on unaddressed for some time but that I had felt that I had been pulling [0:19:00.5] no punches with you because, I did not feel like it was fair to go into your age or your life or the number of years or experiences you had been having. I wanted to sort of start off without. I wanted to just sort of take it on good faith that you were qualified and old enough to sort of know enough to be a grown up. When I started feeling like basically, when things started going very bad for me and you did not seem to respond, or responded only marginally, I was very clear exactly how this all played out and why I need good solid clear explanation for why I was reacting as strongly as I did. Now you are saying my reactions were even stronger than that? That there was something that was not there? [0:20:06.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just a second. First of all one thing I want to ask, you seem to, I am wondering if you are taking my suggestion we should talk about this more as somewhat critical?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I do not understand it. What I am frustrated by is the fact that I am not sure that you remember these. You talk about these in big terms but you are not listening out to what I have already said and then saying you are not being specific at all about what I have already said. Then tell me you are saying the strength of my reaction surprised you. There seems to be something more than that although the that is</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want to explain that. Hang on just a second. I am wondering if you seem to be taking it maybe as either critical because I am saying that maybe you did not give adequate reasons or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you said you were feeling defensive which I suppose [0:21:00.1]</p>

<p>meant that I extrapolated stretch that it is to mean that I was being offensive. That I had over reacted; that I was treating you unfairly. It seems like we are doing this again.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well listen. I want to be clear about this. This whole endeavor is not about laying blame anywhere with you or with me. I think though the reactions that both of us are having are important in understanding what is going on and I am not sure, not that you did not give reasons and not that you did not give valid reasons, but there could be more reasons. I believe that, often times, when these things happen there are a number of reasons that contribute to them. You have already named a number of them. So I just want us to put our heads together more with an attitude of curiosity about [0:21:59.0] than we left something out before or you know you are being offensive. It is not about that. It is not about, I can see. I did not intend it to seem critical.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I do not think you want us to put our heads together I think you have an idea and I think you want to say it. I think you should just go ahead and say it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Actually I do not have an idea. I have some hypothesizes. I have some guesses but these might be right or wrong. For instance, it could have partly to do with the fact that we have to be ending in ten sessions. Another possibility is that there were things going on with Cynthia and other things that I still did not know about that were adding to your frustration. There seem to be many possibilities and rather [0:23:05.3] than me hypothesize about it because I do not know.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well both of the things that you have said are things that I have already mentioned.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things that you mentioned but I do not remember us talking about directly in this context.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And where are we doing because there is intensity?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was my initial thing was that I had a sense there might be more things</p>

<p>PATIENT: Someway somewhere there if fertile ground to be tilled?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just had a sense there might be more going on because you did have a very strong reaction to that one part of that one session that you brought up [0:24:04.8]</p>

<p>a number of times. We have talked about it. I am not saying that we have not talked about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I cannot. I do not think I could have been more complete.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I am starting to wonder if something right now is not happening that was much like what was happening then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well let's see. I was suicidal on Monday and Tuesday. I sobbed like a baby on Wednesday. Talk about being consistent we talked about the time before. For what is going to be an apocalypse in my life right now. I slept with my girlfriend last night. Right now we are going over the perceived overreaction that you have and the defensiveness of two sessions ago. Oh gee. I am just feeling like I do not get [0:25:10.5] why we are doing this and I agree that. I have got to be completely honest. I think, conceited as it might sound, I think that when I explain something I think I do a damn good job of it ok. I gave a complete and thorough rundown, a briefing practically, of what was going on with me in each one of these sessions, and you are probing as though I am being withholding. I mean maybe your other patients do that and maybe there is part of me is doing that. It is like what, I did everything but give you my lecture [0:26:12.2] notes for this session. I was very thorough about everything that was going on and your problem is I give you navigational charts and you are pluming the waters again. I do not get it. I really do not get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this feels really like redundant and dead end to you and we have been down this road before and I was very forthcoming so why are you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was forthcoming and detailed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh huh. So why are you making me go through this again. What is the point of this?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Unless. It would be one thing if you were saying [0:27:01.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are so angry at me. I just</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is just the shock of it. I do not come in here but you sure just seem so dense. I do not know if. Are you not listening? Is there something that I was unclear? Do I have more memory of what we covered? Could it possibly be that what the sentences I used and the things I said, were incomplete? That I need three more sentences for every sentence that I utter and said. I said the parental situation, impossible job situation, destructive personal relationship and incredible personal doubt left over. I have sort of gone over sources of stress and been specific about could you please just let me, give me three minutes to talk about specific situations, or [0:28:11.6] could you let me cry or when I cry could you do this and this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We talked about all this. Yes. Yes. I am. But let me tell you where I am coming from. I am going to be perfectly frank. There seems to be a big confusion here. Here is where I am coming from is that all that you give very detailed reasons and I have not forgotten them, but I believe given the strength of your reaction, I have a sense that there may be other things that are going on that neither of us is completely aware of. I think that is where the action is. I think that is what is interesting, ok. Now I could be wrong. Apparently you have a very different sense of that. But that is what I think and I think there can also be a lot of complexities to those reasons that you gave. Yes you gave very detailed accounts of them but the way they come in here, there can be a [0:29:01.7] lot of nuance to that that is worth talking about. So that is why I am asking the question. It is not that you were incomplete, unclear, not detailed. It is not that I have forgotten or want you to repeat it again or any of that. It does seem as though, you have a very strong reaction to my suggestion you know that week that we talk about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess it seems for lack of a better word, it seems kind of lazy of you to not come in here and say I want to talk about the over reaction that I sensed to close to two weeks ago. I will be straight way to the over reaction. When we talked about [0:30:03.5] it you mentioned this. It all kind of made sense. You can rely on me. Those three things do not add up or those four things do not add up into what took place that day. Now that is a point of departure. You can say that. But when you come in here and you tell me, "I think that we should explore this more." For what? Well this. I have some ideas. but it is like here I am being critical again. And here I am sort of sounding exactly like basically</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let me say something now. My reaction is I do feel like I have a tendency when you say that, you could start like this. I seemed kind of lazy [0:30:58.8] the way you started. I find myself ready to kind of defend myself. Ready to kind of like let's say try to give you the reasons why I start in this different way. See even now I am tempted to say a more open ended way because that puts some kind of positive spin on it. I think that is me being defensive. But I am not sure that giving you those reasons is going to be helpful at all. I think that is just going to feed the fire as it were. Fan the fire. I do not know. Up the ante on this little thing we are doing here.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Claim god made me him do it because it was a pull to come.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you and I if we wanted to could get caught up in just arguing about this stupid model or whatever or the approach or you know. [0:31:59.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was wanting to talk about fucking my ex-girlfriend. I did not need to talk about the model.</p>

<p>It becomes hard though because almost what happened is you came in and you opened with telling me about what happened with Cynthia but I was not really sure if you wanted to talk about that. I admittedly I brought up something different and then it became very quickly why are we talking about this. We can go, I do not know if you have the sense, but I get the feeling that you and I could go round and round about something like that. Why are we talking about this? Does that [0:33:03.9]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Your idea sure. We agreed not to. We try not to. We agree not to do that five or ten sessions ago. Not to go round and round about the theory.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is it? Why are we doing it again?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I have no idea.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Can I? Let me hazard a guess. This is just a guess. Tell me what you think. You may think this is totally wrong. I am wondering now if in [0:33:59.5] someway it is in not somehow safer for both of us. Somehow easier, even though it seems like pretty much arguing, you know, both of us back and forth taking turns being critical or defensive, if in a way that is not safer than other things we may be talking about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well since we are getting frank. I will tell you. I think it is easier for you ok. I think I am developing a strong suspicion that you are uncomfortable with my crying. I am just curious. You call it fake but tears and it sounds like you are talking about other people basically taking advantage of their patients At the same time I am not so sure that you are comfortable with it. I am not so sure you are comfortable with my being uncomfortable with the topic. So you start shifting and have another one ready to go and even when I was, I may have been uncomfortable talking about Cynthia, I think [0:35:06.2] that I was clearly less comfortable talking about going round and round in circles. I do not think I was the impetus for pushing it through which now has almost been our entire session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I brought it up. I am not denying that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now at the end of the session you are saying I think we do this because</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But wait a minute. But wait a minute. But wait a minute. I brought up a topic for us to discuss but I did not intend it. I had no intention of it turning into an issue of why we have to talk about this. So I am not sure there was not something more complicated going on between the two of us. I want to acknowledge what you were saying before. You know it may be in some ways easier for me. It may be in [0:36:00.5] some ways safer for me. I am not. That is a possibility. I am wondering if. I am trying not to do that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To have this be a discussion about theory.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Many discussions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Many discussions. I am trying not to, as I said before, when you say something to defend myself and saying here are my reasons for saying it this way. It seems you do not want to talk about it either. Here we are both not wanting to talk about it and it happens again. That is bewildering to me. I am struggling with what this [0:37:03.6]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am bewildered by what and how I could have taken what you were putting it off. I just seems so vague. It was not our over reaction. It was my over reaction. There was no sort of explanation on the part of these (inaudible at 0:37:26.7). Why did you over react so much more strongly than you think you should have? Now where I am I supposed to go with that? It is not. Talk about and what we are talking about is you, the reason that we are talking about this is because you felt almost defensive. Heaven forbid. The past three sessions, you have been very critical. I have felt that. [0:38:01.5] I am paraphrasing you. The past few sessions I have felt that you have been very critical. I am just not sure how I am supposed to take that. Oh gee it might have been the absence of prosecuting. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was a joke. I liked that one.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you said, "Actually I have got some hypotheses but I just want to throw it open." Ok. What do I do? Talk about my lack of time in libraries?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you did take it a particular way. It seemed to me that you took it in a particular way. That you felt I was being critical of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You told me I had been critical of you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You took that as something of a criticism from me. I think that you took and not just that, just took my asking about it as. It seemed to me that you did. [0:39:04.0] Maybe I am wrong. But you seem to</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am sitting here asking you how. Well give me another scenario. What else what other reactions. Give me one other. Give me a non defensive reaction. Give me an example of somebody who sits here and plays out what you think is going to be appropriate or not an appropriate answer but you mentioned about your hypotheses. Say one of those was true. I am sitting here thinking would not nine out of ten people sitting here feel like basically you have been ragging on me pretty hard for the last three sessions and I do not want to go into that now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No. I actually do not see. No it does not seem unlikely to [0:40:02.0] me at all that someone could take that as inviting an exploration of something that seemed important. That is what I intended it to be. You seem to take that as we have not. Tell me again what.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Explanations apply. You were so critical in the last three sessions I am going to sit here</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once again it is not about blaming you for being critical, it is that you are angry and upset about things and there are reasons for that and I think that is important to talk about. The criticism is not the end. It is not the whole what it is all about. It is that there was a lot going on and I am not sure we have really had a chance to explore that as carefully as we could have. But again, here we are again we [0:41:06.1] seem to be back to square one with talking about what are the reasons for that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just seems like a very kind of unproductive session.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe the starting point is I bring up something that you do not think is was going to be helpful.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well. I just. It seemed like a topic that came out of nowhere. It did not</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It did. It did.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why would you bring up a topic that came out of nowhere? I mean which is there is all this time, there are several times that you have mentioned letting this discussion take place in the here and now and then this thing seems to. [0:42:02.6]</p>

<p>I am almost getting the impression that I see your advisor is telling you, "Why don't you pick this topic for your next session." or something like that. I do not see where this came from but it did not come out of the fact that at 11:30 my pants are at my ankles. It is just like</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you are right. Look I am not going to. There is nothing magical here. The fact is it was on my mind and I thought it was important to talk about and I was not sure you wanted to talk about the Cynthia thing. There seemed to be a lull and I took the opportunity to bring this up. That is it. There is not any. I do not have any grand plans about it. That was basically it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well we did spend 40 minutes on it though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do not feel like, as you said, that it is an unproductive session in the sense that I do not feel that we have not gotten anywhere on that. I am [0:43:04.4] starting to feel like I have a lot of questions. What is going on?</p>

<p>PATIENT: With?</p>

<p></p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is? I feel like I am at a loss. What is happening? That we had an undirected session about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We may not have a love connection here Jim. It may just be that we do not produce. If you call down the blame, then it seems you won that one. I for as long as I can remember we have gotten to right on the cusp of productive sort of moment and then all of the sudden right out of nowhere you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute. That is something different. Let's talk about that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well your. It is not something different. [0:44:01.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well no. Wait. There is something. We were on the cusp of discussing something really important there when this came up? Let me ask you the question more directly. Did you want to discuss this whole thing with Cynthia in the session?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I do not know if today would have been a great day under any conditions. I know there have been, I can think or three or four times, where I thought something really interesting was being discussed. It felt really important to me. It felt like there was resolution at hand and then all of the sudden.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I am asking is, is this one of those times?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. As I just said, this seemed like a session that would not go well under any conditions. I am tired and weirded out. I am tired and weirded out and this has been one of the biggest up down week I have every. Pulled a pistol out of my mouth on Tuesday and on Friday I am in bed with this model. The type that is in [0:45:20.2] agony. I am tired. I am not going to be very introspective in these conditions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well let me ask you. I just want ask how you, it seems important to ask, you have had this up and down week. How are you feeling? Are you doing ok now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am numb right now. I think that the question that I started with at the beginning of the session or the musings that I have at the beginning of the session, now remain at the end of the session. I feel sort of curious as to why this has happened. I am curious as to whether or not that there are things I should have or could have [0:46:03.8] abandoned in here that did not happen. Basically, sort of was the security or resolution that I had hoped to get through this program.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have I kept that from happening?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I am saying, I am wondering if, I did not want to go into it but now that I have been around the MC Usher print a couple of times, I am ready to state it as a suspicion. That in many ways the incompleteness, I feel, I am suspicious of the incompleteness of what happens here has not helped me resist getting solace in things that I do not think are healthy for me. We even started down that road. You [0:47:05.6] said I think your instincts are exactly the opposite; you want to be with them. We started off and that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then I changed it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And here on our appointment 40 minutes later, we are off on. Does that</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know I am still. I think it is funny. You talk about it but still maybe it is just me, I am still unclear whether or not you really wanted to talk about that or not. It was unclear to me from the beginning and I am still not sure. You do not seem to be saying so clearly to me that that is what I want to be talking about and you did not let me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I was sure clear about not wanting to talk about this other thing. I mean if you have the (inaudible at 0:47:50.9) at the end of ten minutes, I said, "Now why are we doing this?" [0:48:00.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean. Ok. Whether or not you wanted to talk about it. Are you feeling ok? Are you feeling a little better? On Wednesday you were really under the ragged end.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I seem to be ok now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am suspicious that these things for some reason running in ten day cycles. Whether or not. I have no idea. I have no idea how this will play out in the coming ten days I know who to call if it gets really bad. Thankfully enough, Cynthia is [0:49:08.4] going to Europe so things are likely to be much more docile. So why don't we just. All I have to do is make it through the next five or six days and I will be fine. It should be fine.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like you are feeling a little bit better than you were on Wednesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know in a way today's session, all sessions are, but today's session was really a microcosm of this struggle that you and I have had. This impasse that you and I have had the whole time. We talked about the impasse many times before, but the same thing. What are we going to talk about. Who is setting the agenda [0:50:04.9]</p>

<p>here? What is this all about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I agree. Yeah. I do not. If this</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well look let's. I am not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I feel that this is unproductive. I think if we have to. I do not mean this to be a threats but I mean the only thing is we should say this is unproductive and we should not be doing this. I think what is the point? If it can unproductive up and it [0:51:06.1] can be unproductive. If three or four sessions of these things and we were producing something, but I keep waiting for the something. I felt last session was pretty interesting and I felt like I trusted you enough to be emotional in front of you and, I did not think you were at all supportive while I was doing it but it worked. You were not unsupportive, you were not hostile or anything. It was kind of interesting. I felt relaxed. My blood pressure was handling it. I do not know what my blood pressure was but I am sure I felt better. I was kind of hoping for a day talk today and to just kind of go on, but I felt weird but I am not feeling particularly hostile so I thought I would let bygones be bygones and stuff like this. I am waiting for this era of peace and this era of [0:52:00.8]</p>

<p>good will. It just sort of settled between us where I finally say, "Jim I trust you, you are a good guy." and you say, "Yeah Mike I trust you, you are a good guy." and we are very interact in some kind of congenial ways in some experimental but interesting ways something like that but it just like I keep waiting for this to ever happening. It turns into this testy, pissy, thing or at least I. You can call it a rehashing of who sets the agenda here, but from where I sit, and I do not mean to be, although I am being critical again, it just feels like you are not rolling with the counseling or you are not rolling [0:53:02.0] with the issues despite the fact that you say, "I am supposed to start." Why?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well look again today I am not bullshitting you about this. I brought up another subject that I thought was important. Ok. So I am not going to deny that yet. You are right. But the sessions, you know, this session did not go. If I had expectations about the way this session were to go, which I imagine I do, and it not only worked out. This is not the way I wanted the session to go or saw the session going either. So, I think there is a lot going on. I am not sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sure. Absolutely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is an easy enough blanket statement to make right. There is a lot going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Whether it is my life or your life; that is another issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. Or both of our life's. Anyway we are not going to be [0:54:01.0] able to wrap our minds around it in this immediate moment and say what this session was about. I expect we will see what happens next session.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I am glad you are feeling a little better.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thanks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When is a good time next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess next week will be it for a while so I think Wednesday at 6:00.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wednesday at 6:00. Let me just check but I think that sounds fine. That is the 29th yeah. No problem. Ok. [0:55:01.4]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. So I will see you next Wednesday. Take it easy.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. You are going to be gone the week after?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. You are going to be gone too you said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I will be gone for the week too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: On vacation?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I will be out of the country.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Ok. Well I will let you go breath. I will see you next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ok. I will see you next week. Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thanks. [0:55:34.7]</p>

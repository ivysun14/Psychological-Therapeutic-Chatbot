<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They gave me your chart number code that's different. You had a different name then.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, that's right, that's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bad name.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bad name, right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh [INAUDIBLE]. Only got the Geodon pill.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The other ones I already had.  And I didn't know what Cogentin was. He didn't explain it to me.  I was uncomfortable with what the medication is. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.  Okay, that's what you're, you're asking-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right so how long were you there?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A week.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  What kind of problem, what kind of experience was it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It was actually good.  I mean, I don't have a basis for comparison, but I think they did a good job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hopefully you never will.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's true.  They got me on, they have different stages they call it. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They have me on what they call Stage One for the first two and a half days which  was, nobody would leave me alone.  Someone had to be by my side twenty four seven.  Even when I went to the bathroom.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then, and I was, I didn't get to see the doctor till Monday and then Monday they looked to be Stage Two which was-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So when did you go, on Friday?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I went Friday night.  I didn't get admitted, it took like four hours between doing all the paperwork and stuff and they had two emergencies come in which interrupted which is fine, I mean by ambulance I get priority.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it just, it got progressively better after that.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's good.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Can I keep this?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can keep that.  All right. Okay.  So-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't know if I needed to take the Cogentin.  They said it had something to do with countering the Geodon.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but it depends, now you're [INAUDIBLE], that was in, well, actually, did we go up to that much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We, you just gave me the samples.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, and I-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I didn't start them before I went in.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, you didn't?  Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, huh-uh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wasn't sure because I knew it was only gonna be a couple days and then they were probably going to switch me.  I thought.  And then of course they ended up giving me, and I never even mentioned to them that you gave me the samples  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Really?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I never even mentioned it at all.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  That's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So what's this, you're taking one 40 in the morning and 80 at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Are you-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't take, I didn't take them today.  I was having stomach problems so I haven't been able to eat this morning yet. I ate something that didn't agree with me last night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But the stuff that you gave me, that paperwork, it says if you don't take it with food [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So, normally what I do with my other medication is I take it on an empty stomach in the morning.  So if I take this right after breakfast and then right after dinner is that okay?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.  I just have to go get breakfast. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> What does that say?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know what that says, something... </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Capsule R08.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And the fish egg, isn't it raw fish eggs?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I don't know what, I've never seen that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Ah well. All right so some of the things like sometimes Geodon will cause muscle-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twitch.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Either like twitching or like it just, like when you get like this, it's very unlikely.  I mean it's much more likely with some of the older medications.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But occasionally, you know, it'll happen.  I don't necessarily, well it says to take it here every six hours as needed.  So obviously you don't need it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I didn't, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sometimes you can also get this motor restlessness. Something called Akathisia, but that when you pace, and move, but...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is it something I'm gonna notice if it happens or that I could just...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean you generally, you probably would have had it already. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know.  I mean did you go right away up to this dose or-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You just started right away on it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Or you started it-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They started me on 40 and 40.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And you stayed awake during the day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  Well, they had me on Ativan too.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh God.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The first, yeah, the first two nights over the weekend they had me on Ativan.  They started me on that Monday.  Gave it to me, I think just Monday night.  And then Tuesday morning and Tuesday night, 40 each, and then they ramped me all the way up.  I did not get out of bed on Tuesday. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Between the Ativan and that.  I couldn't function.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You got used to it fast.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pardon?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sounds like you got used to it pretty quickly.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I guess.  I didn't realize it was that, and I kept asking them why am I so tired, why am I so tired.  They told me it was the Ativan.  And so even after they took me off the Ativan I was a little bit sleepy.  They said no, no, no, it's not this.  And then when I got home I read that sheet you gave me.  It said like, it will make you tired.  So-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But you're used to it now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think so.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean I'm not sleepier than normal.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, that's great.  And it's working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess it is, I mean I don't know if the full effect is in my system or not but since I've been there I felt a heck of a lot better.  I don't have any of those urges any more. You know they wanted to put me on the first two medications, the doctor recommended were Lithium and was it Depakote I think?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but that's-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I told them no.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I just, I read too many bad things about Lithium.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, and you're not, I mean I um, as long as they weren't putting you on Zyprexa.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That was one that they mentioned.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's been all over the news.  She ran down a list of a whole bunch of them and then the side effects of some were weight gain.  And I'm like, you have to be crazy, you can't tell me that there's some that have a side effect of weight gain and some that don't.  Of course I'm gonna say that I want some that don't. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, of course.  I mean, yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So that eliminated a bunch of options and...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, but I think, you know, I thought that because of your symptoms that they wanted you on this class of medications.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But that was also the weekend doctor. It was the regular doctor that gave me the Geodon.  [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess he's a full-time doctor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Let's, so you had an overall positive experience.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Very, yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's great.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I guess the people that were worse than me which, as sad as it sounds, made me feel better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Did they?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Made me feel like it could be a lot worse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There's one poor girl that her arms from here to here on both arms were shredded and burnt with like, I think they were cigarette burns and razor. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's horrible.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Horrible. I don't know what to do about the, I guess the reason I get like that.  Like having a hard time.  I guess talking about what's bothering me, that I don't know what to do about because the group therapy was fine.  The medication's fine.  But it doesn't get to the root of, so do you have any recommendations for that other than I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I mean, is that the best? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, I mean, are you comfortable?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh yeah, I like him a lot.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you see him enough to-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Probably not. I don't always see him, I usually only see him once or twice a month.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You still traveling a lot?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.  I probably [INAUDIBLE] but I've never brought this up because I haven't told anybody about it really, except for that incident that you knew about, that's it.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Um, well, I'm glad you finally got comfortable enough to talk about it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well.Yeah. Got worse- </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, or uncomfortable enough that you-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah exactly.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But it doesn't, that's another thing at the hospital, they should help, it doesn't bother me to say it now.  Like when I first went in every time it, they would just say your name and why you're here, I would just bawl.  Now I don't have the same reaction.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> When's your next appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With him?  At noon today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, that's good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I made appointments before I went over [INAUDIBLE] knowing that-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Before you went in?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well when I saw you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Last week I saw him also.  Thinking just in case my travel schedule gets out of hand, at least I know-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can see him right away.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's probably fairly, they must have been very impressed with you in the hospital.  Generally, you know, they have to call and make appointments and make sure somebody will follow up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's true they used to do that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> [INAUDIBLE] for them ahead of time so that was-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well they were freaked out when I came from [DEIDENTIFIED]. They were like, why did you come all the way from [DEIDENTIFIED] and I told them, I said I've been researching this for like three weeks.  I didn't like the doctor, the hospital rather, they recommended.  The other ones that I knew like [DEIDENTIFIED] and stuff, I just, I didn't wanna wait.  And I called [DEIDENTIFIED] and they will take me right away.  They're like, you've been looking into this for three weeks? I'm like yeah while I haven't been in the middle of like a fit. Isn't that the best time to-and they were just kind of surprised.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well that was, I don't know.  That's, but it's good, I mean you got to kind of shape your own destiny. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Trying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, as opposed to like, you know, getting to where it's completely, you know, have no choice, you either go immediately, you know, so...</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well the alternative was me getting rushed in an ambulance to [DEIDENTIFIED] which I didn't want.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I mean, that's-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why I happened to mention it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, that's, I mean you've had enough wherewithal to do something about it before that happened which is great.  Yeah.  So-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Is any of what I'm on, I have an eye twitch before the Geodon.  I have this eye twitch I've had for a couple months.  My doctor thought it was my thyroid because I'm on Synthroid for hypothyroidism, but they tested me and they said my level is fine but it won't go away.  Is there anything else I'm on that you know that could cause it?  Or anything in particular?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, I don't think so.  What's the, you're on Spironolactone?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's for my hair loss.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's right, that's right. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just, this just started a few months ago like when I shut this eye, this eye, the eyelid twitches.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Doesn't stop or-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Doesn't stop.  It stops, well, I take it back. It stops for a couple weeks and this is March, I'm looking at February.  Either that or I wasn't noticing it as much but otherwise it seems like it's been constant. I'm not sure what to do about it, it's getting annoying.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well, I don't know.  I would say, are you, you're not, are you still taking these other meds?  [INAUDIBLE] you on. The Wellbutrin, Ritalin? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I stopped those.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're off those.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm supposed to stop, right? </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I don't know, we didn't really talk about that but yeah, but I would stop this um-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They have me stop them just because they were giving me the Geodon. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well yeah.  I'd stay off the, the Wellbutrin.  And let's hold the Ritalin because you may be able to, if you need to we may able to look at that.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, I'll just keep it in my closet.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Their diagnosis was bipolar I.   </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Bipolar I.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's uh, more severe.  One and two right now, that's what the diagnosis [INAUDIBLE] </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well... </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which, you know, they've seen me as long as you have and the diagnosis I had before was from a previous doctor, so I'm not sure where I lie.  They said they think that ADHD symptoms are actually from the bipolar. They overlap or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah but I mean if you have, you know, if that's what you have, um, you know it's much more common, to have ADHD if you're bipolar but the symptoms, you know, sometimes it's difficult to-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Distinguish.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, distinguish that.  But I mean you also have some other somewhat unusual symptoms that don't necessarily get along one or the other of those and stuff.  You know.  But, whatever it is, I mean generally, I guess if you're on too much Synthroid that could throw things off or if you're not on enough with the depression.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Well I get that tested every few months. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  But I think that the, you know, with the Geodon, you know, that'll help not only with the mood symptoms but also with the-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The ADHD symptoms.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well I don't know so much.  I mean it might help some like activity, impulsiveness a little but also some of the thought process stuff, you know, I think that that that's why I wanted you on the medicine in that class as opposed to just a mood stabilizer, Depakote or Lithium because you know, I wanted to make sure we got some control over these, these thought processes that were-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I can tell the difference.  I don't feel like my mind's racing all the time now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I feel like I went from like way up here to down a little.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  That's the idea, the drive and you know, the stuff like that.  So, all right.  Anyway, I don't know.  I mean if you get like, we talked about these side effects you know.  If you don't fill the Congestin which probably, I wouldn't bother, um, if you have any of those side effects you can use Benadryl if you have that, or you can buy that over the counter.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know that may make you tired but at this point I don't imagine you'll have any problem since you don't at the current time.  All right, so, now do you have, how much do, do you have a refill on that?  Probably not, right?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, they just gave me 30 days. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, 90 capsules, no refills.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  Do you use the Spironolactone all the time?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I take two every morning.  200 mg total I think it is.  Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And that's working?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, my hair's not falling out.  It's not doing anything to like add anything to it but it's not falling out like when I first went to see him they did this thing-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were saying.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I had a wop of it coming out. Does any of this effect eyesight either?  Because I've noticed my eyes are, I don't know if it's age or-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, yeah, I mean it's like, it's the focus?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  I just noticed that the last few weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Trouble reading?  Or blurry a little or-?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> A little.  Hard to explain.  Like-</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Before the [INAUDIBLE] before the Geodon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, no, it was before that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, it was before that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Hmm.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just like, I can see everything but sometimes it'll feel like I have to look harder at stuff just a little bit further away.  But that could just be my eyes getting old.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I mean what, that would be the most likely.  Cogentin wouldn't particularly help that but I don't know.  Synthroids, Spironolactone, I have no idea if that would do anything.  I don't know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. I've been...</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's no better or worse off the Wellbutrin and on the Geodon?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No. It isn't.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll just go get a check-up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> My dad said right when he hit [AGE] he needed glasses and I'm gonna be [AGE] this year, so it could just be the, I'm going to [AGE] soon. I feel weird.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well-</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It happens, I know.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It does, [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You want this back?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.  I'll keep it in here.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, so, do you, how soon do you want to, want to come back? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Deciding what's easier.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's all right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Um, I don't know.  I'm thinking, I know we were doing every like three months but maybe just this time just to make sure the medicine, or I can just set it up every 3 months to call you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.  Yeah, I would, I don't, six weeks at the most.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Four weeks.  Six weeks.  Something.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay. Let me set it up for four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> With my travel, even if I have to push it out then I'm still getting here by six weeks.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  All right.  So when did you fill this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think it was, it was filled [DATE] so, Friday.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  Oh it was Friday, Friday night.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So I'll tell you what.  Just so you have enough, I'll make sure you have enough.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE] mail order.  I think they'll give me two more months to fill at the pharmacy and then I have to mail order.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's expensive. Can't believe it. I had to pay a hundred bucks after my insurance paid three hundred fifty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Why?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> For 30 days.  My portion was like ninety seven dollars and the insurance paid three forty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Whoa, whoa, whoa, do you have the percent?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You don't have like a tier.  You have to pay a percent of the medicine?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I think that's what it is.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Call and find out.  It's going to be cheaper to get thirties, forties and thirty eighties.  Because they eighties probably don't cost much more than the forties.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  Probably not.</p>

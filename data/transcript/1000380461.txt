<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I'll feel, I'll feel like I'm not wording it right. And I'll feel like, oh Jesus, this doesn't sound right. Or what is she going to react, how is she going to react to this? So then I have to turn it and reiterate it and turn it around. Turning around in my mind, I'm going, uh, uh, uh. (Laughs) (Inaudible at 0:00:15.3) To sort of cut up a sentence. But it's really funny that I feel, I still feel that inferiority. In the mental. I can feel it. I can feel like she's a lot ahead of me. So, like a lot of things she's done. Like she's had office romances. She says, "Don't ever go out with the boss or anybody in the office."</p>

<p>And I said, "Well who am I going to go with? I don't know anybody at aerobics." I've been changing from Mondays to Fridays to Saturdays. Now probably back to Fridays. And I never got to know anybody. She's been on one day all the time. Or just about. And so she's met everybody. She's been going four or five months longer than I have. The head instructor likes her. So I mean she's got like people all over. She's secure in this place. And that's only thing I do. And then I go out with the other boss because she said, "(inaudible at 0:01:08.8)." Well he's the only one I know really at the other place. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard to meet people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's very hard for me. Well partially, all right, it's a big firm. And you don't want to date people in the office. That kills the office. I go to aerobics and there, well on Saturdays most of the people are young. I used to go on Saturdays all the time. And there's a few girls. And that's it. There's young fellas and there's girls. And then like that's the only thing I'm really in. Besides that other work thing. And I go out with that other boss. So after telling me, she said, "Well there's no problem with it." And I said, "Where do you meet fellas?" You're always coming in with fellas. She teaches. And she doesn't go out with her students.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I said, "Where do you meet these fellas?" She said, "I don't know." She won't tell me. She can't tell me she just walks down the street and somebody just walks up and talks to her. I don't believe that. And yet she says it's not dances or anything like that she just meets people. So I tried to figure out myself, well what am I doing wrong? Maybe I should go out to eat more or something. Because I've met a lot of people at the health store. When I used to go down there. But I can't afford to eat out. [0:02:15.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [It sounds like] (ph) that's no help. Oftentimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. She doesn't tell me where she meets them. And like she says, "Be very careful if somebody starts talking to you on the street. Or something." So I'm sure she doesn't just walk down the street and somebody says, "Hi," and you go, "Hi." And start a conversation. But we'll do this at the beach. But we won't do this like walking downtown or something. There's too many kooks. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's a weird thing. It used to happen during the summertime too. This kind of stuff was me. And I know it's partly me. I used to bring these books down so I'd look intelligent. And I'd bring my books down. (Inaudible at 0:02:51.4) And I'd try to read my art books and I'd tried to read this and that. So that I'd look like I was doing something. And she'd have her business law book out there or something. (Chuckles) You know? Right? </p>

<p>So then who comes up to these real smart people? Because you've got our business law or marketing book out there. But one of the things that kind of struck me is one fellow came up to her and said, what did he say? He talked to her. And she said afterwards, "You know that what he said to me?" And I said, "What?" He said, "He goes to the beach and he looks for the girl who looks like she doesn't give a damn about anybody the most. That's the one I go up and talk to." And it just hit me, sure, here I was trying so hard to look like I was intelligent. To look like I was this and that. That I wasn't giving myself time to really like just relax and be me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that woke me up for awhile. And then I started going right back into it again. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like that's what you've been saying. Like you keep moving between trying to present some image to the world and then just being really you. And that feels much better to be you. You keep getting pushed into-</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Yeah. Right. I get pushed into, well I push myself into it. Because I feel inadequate. So I feel like if I'm more like this person, they'll like me more. Because I tried it being me. And they didn't like me. So now I'm going to try and be her and see if they like her. (Chuckling) Well partly though, partly I was being her when I even started like say, aerobics. [0:04:18.6]</p>

<p>And she said, "What you do is you pick up your little things and you leave. And then people kind of wonder where you're going and who you are and everything." Well I did that. But they didn't wonder. (Laughs) You know, like I walked out and nobody. (Inaudible at 0:04:30.0) nobody and then that would be it. But like I like this one instructor there. Not the head instructor, but his best friend who is like the next instructor. Well he turned out to like my other girlfriend. Well she's real tiny. And he's Japanese. And naturally Japanese fellas are going to like tiny girls. Usually. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But for you, it was, "Oh, no, not again." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I said, "Ah, Jesus." And I knew that I would not be competition for her either because she's got the big eyes. And the cute little accent and everything. And she's also foreign born which helps. Like I guess they don't really usually like American girls that much. My other girlfriend is foreign born too. From Sweden. So here I am. </p>

<p>And then they've got a younger instructor. And I said, "Well he's kind of cute. Maybe he'll like me." (Chuckles) You know? I don't care. I just want to go out with somebody. I want somebody to be nice to me. So he's real nice and sweet. But I think he likes Jodie too. So you know, it's just like, I don't really care anymore with her friends. I just want to branch out on my own. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like when I went Kabbalah, the girl who taught- in fact she called me and she wants me to take teacher's training under her. And I might do it. I don't know. We would go out. Like I would go out with Susan who is (inaudible at 0:05:45.3). And I'd go out with Wendy. And then there might be some other people. But it was always Wendy, I and Susan. Sometimes it would only be the three of us. And we'd go out. And we'd talk. And we'd have a ball. We'd go out to eat or something. And then we'd go home. But it was really, I was really getting kind of close to these people. Because they always wanted me along. They always asked me, "Do you want to go?" I said, "Oh yeah. I'd love to go." </p>

<p>And it was just like I could fit in there because none of my girlfriends were there as almost like competitors. And like when Eliza was going, I had a problem. Because a lot of the people liked Eliza. And she went all the time. So they knew her better too. That was part of it. But I always go on a class night. When there wouldn't be anybody there but me. And other people of course. But as far as my two girlfriends go. I could be me. I wouldn't have to worry. I wouldn't have to act like her. But I could be me. And people there liked me. [0:06:33.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah and that's really good. And then when you (inaudible at 0:06:38.2).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Right. But when I feel like well, there would sometimes be fellas there too. But I'd still be me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But partly because those would be my friends. See when I'm working on this type of thing, like even with aerobics, when I started aerobics she was there almost six months already. Four months or something like that. Four or five months. She had already had her friends set. So I'm coming in fresh and cold. I don't know. The instructor already liked her as a girlfriend. So it's like you're coming after somebody's already been, who's got such a fantastically magnetic personality that everybody likes her. And it's very hard to sort of, I don't even want to upstage her, just to be like me. But accepted too. And liked. It's very hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's time to stop.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh. (Laughs) Okay. What a day. I got to go to sleep on the train on the way back I think. Oh that's terrible. I got four hours sleep last night. We were cleaning again. It was so funny. I was cleaning the outside of the door and this fella comes in and he lives upstairs. I grabbed the bucket, spilled half of it on the rug, pulled it inside, realized I left my keys outside the door too. If he would've been a strangler or something I would've been dead right now. (Chuckling) It was so funny. (Laughs) [0:07:57.1] [end of audio]</p>

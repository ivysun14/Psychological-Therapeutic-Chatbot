<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hello.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Hi.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you just coming from work?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I got down here a while ago. Oh, and I had something to eat. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. So, this is that moment when now we wonder, I suppose, what exactly we're going to talk about. But I would like to talk about whatever you would like to talk about. What is on your mind?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not much. I had an interesting weekend and week. My best friend, who has a lover, who I think is kind of immature and I tolerate it, but I think I've gotten at my wit's end with him. [0:01:07] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We were supposed to go to the Chinese fair in Claremont, we talked about this at a party about two weeks ago, and she had a change of heart. And she decided that she didn't want to go, and she got angry because my best friend and I went anyway. And kind of spent the whole evening hearing from her with a cell phone, on how she wanted to [inaudible 0:01:34] the relationship and I felt responsible. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because she was with me and I think she was trying to not break our plans and kind of let her lover know that it is not OK to be controlling, they did agree on this. They patched up, but it is not the first time that she has made me feel uncomfortable about spending time with my friend. </p>

<p>One time I stayed over which I used to do more often when she was single, and she made a big deal of it in front of me, "Why didn't I know she was staying over?" I kind of expressed to her that she was making me uncomfortable. </p>

<p>But anyway, I think I've reached my wit's end with her, I don't want to be bothered with her. And I'm concerned because three years ago I had another mutual friend, we all grew up together, I lost a friendship because she ended up with a woman who was- we didn't get along- and she chose her lover over our friendship. And wants nothing to do with me. Which is fine with me, because it just- either we outgrew each other or just don't agree about what the friendship really meant. But I'm concerned at this point that we even have to tolerate my best friend's lover, because I don't want to lose her friendship.[0:03:13] </p>

<p>So I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. I didn't want it to [inaudible phrase 0:03:15] I really don't. But I'm kind of OK with it. I'm kind of concerned with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, you're kind of OK and you're kind of concerned? Both?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I'm OK with the fact that I don't spend any time with them, because of it. That is OK. But I am concerned about losing my best friend's friendship because of it. So be it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although it sounds like if you don't get to spend time with them, or you don't get to spend time with your best friend without her lover, then you are still losing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Right. But it is OK. It is. Because I have put up with it quite a bit. And also they're -  we saw each other on Thursday. There's this woman that we were sort of dating but she's got a lot of issues...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, I'm sorry, a woman that you and your best friends...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, this is a separate situation. This is a situation that came up during the week. That [inaudible 0:04:39] with my best friend, and I really don't want to be involved. I want to voice that to her and I want to see how it goes. Like I said, I'm concerned because I already lost a friend because I voiced my dislike for her lover. But if it ends, it is OK. You know, our friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If this current friendship ends?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is OK?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is OK. And then there is this woman that I was sort of seeing, but she has a lot of issues. She had gone on vacation about two weeks ago, and I spoke to her and I said, "Look, you have issues, I really want to grow, I want to move forward when you come back. You made it very clear that you're not interested in pursuing any sort of relationship. I think I'm ready and I need somebody that is a lot healthier. So when you come back, the mixed messages that you give me has to stop." </p>

<p>She called me on Friday, after she promised she wouldn't, after coming back from vacation. And I spoke to her and her behavior was a little bit puzzling to me. She was fine and then she said she got another call. She asked if she could call me back and I said yes. When she called me back, she asked if she could ask me a question and I said OK. And then she kind of rambled on, "Everybody is interested, everybody wants to know- wants me to know how they feel about me but nobody cares who I like. And I have nobody to talk to." And she started to cry. [0:06:25]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: She was telling you she has no one to talk to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. So I told her, "You can talk to me." She says, "Forget it, forget it, forget it." So, I said, "No, you can call me." She says, "Well, I need to cry, call me back in ten minutes." I did, because I was concerned. When I called her back she said she was on the phone with her daughter and I had a gut feeling it wasn't true. She said, "Call me back later." I called her back in an hour, she said she is still on the phone with her daughter. Her fifteen year old daughter who was babysitting at a friend's house. So I just hung up. And I got annoyed because I felt, the deal was, "Let's leave it alone, stop giving me mixed messages." And she continued to do so. </p>

<p>And I just said to myself, enough. I'm not going to accept her calls. If she calls me, I'm going to say, "I think you're playing head games that is [inaudible 0:07:26] So those two things happened this week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK, about the first one you were explaining to me about with your best friend...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess I'm a little puzzled because this is someone who you're describing as your best friend.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I've known her for twenty years.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Twenty years? That is a long time. And you're also saying that if the friendship evaporates because of the conflict between you and her lover then that is OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It has to be OK. It has to be. It is OK. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Help me understand that. [0:08:04]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm concerned because already I lost a friend that I knew 25 years because of the same circumstances. This has been going on -  They've been together five years. I would say this has been going on for the last year. Where her lover has become very insensitive to our friendship, gets jealous, says things that I wouldn't say to someone else in my situation. So it has been going on for a while. So I think on Friday I decided I wasn't going to put up with it anymore. </p>

<p>My best friend, she can be stubborn at times, and she's not easy to talk to. But I think she's going to realize that there is going to be some distance between us. And when she brings this up, I'm going to voice how I feel. "I feel this problem is between me and your lover and I don't feel that I want to put up with it anymore."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're going to wait for her to bring it up. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. She probably will.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if she doesn't?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then just [inaudible 0:09:27] We'll spend time like we usually do. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it sounds like you're anticipating that this is pretty much it for the friendship in some way or another. That either there'll be the break between the two of you because of the issue with her lover, or you'll grow apart because you're not going to spend much time together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is OK?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is. I think I can grow with it, if that is the way it is going to go. But I think the bottom line of what I'm trying to say is that I've decided not to put up with her anymore. And I'm hoping that it will work out where me and my friend will spend time one on one, you know, occasionally. And if not, if she, if we discuss and there is sort of like a silent understanding that I just don't want to put up with it anymore, we'll grow apart without any bad feelings and I'll just do what I have to do to make change in my life. And I'll move on with other things. Maybe someone who is not in a relationship or I won't spend so much time with someone who is in a relationship. [0:11:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although your friend wasn't in this relationship for the first 25 years you knew her...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that is a little bit hard to predict. What do you think you'll feel if say, you grow apart and the friendship really comes to an end? </p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'd feel a little angry, because it has happened before and I am angry at my previous friend for, not choosing me over her lover, but excluding me altogether. I feel something could have been worked out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although it sounds like you're thinking not this time. In terms of something being worked out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably it could be worked out. But I don't know. I can't predict how she is going to take it, or I'm not sure. I guess I'm going through, I'm going by the two years I've [inaudible 0:12:11] And since I've put up with it for a year, maybe she is spoiled or taking it for granted that it will be OK. Then once she sees that I mean business, I'm not going to put up with it anymore, it happens every time we go out. She limits us, "Let's go home." And that is not something we have been doing for the last 25 years. When we go out we don't worry about time, time limits, we go out and have a good time and it is not like that an awful lot. But for the sake of my friendship with my best friend, I put up with it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who's name is?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Beth. I put up with it. I put up with it. But on Friday for some reason I just had it. Enough already. Because all three of us were supposed to go to the festival, the Chinese festival, and she changed her mind. Went back home. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, if I understand right, what your plan is, to the extent that you plan on doing something here, is to just spend less time with Beth and if she picks up on that, then you'll tell her about your feelings with her lover?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And why I'm being distant. [0:13:50]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if she never asks, you will do what then? Bring it up, not bring it up?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not bring it up. Because I think we know each other well enough, that if she doesn't bring it up it is because she really doesn't want to discuss it. She doesn't want to discuss her lover and how I feel about her. She knows me well enough.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm trying to put together the picture because it sounds like it is an important friendship and one that you've had for a very long time. But on the one hand you're saying that you don't know how Beth is going to react to things as they unfold. You don't know how she would react to your saying that there is a problem between you and her lover on the one hand.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know what she'll say, "Don't pay her any mind, I do what I want." But that is not the issue this time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The issue is that I've had it. I don't want to deal with it anymore. I really think it is unfair for her to make me feel uncomfortable so many times. So I feel it is best that we spend less time together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You and Beth spend less time together?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And let her spend as much time as she wants with -  as much time as her lover feels she needs with her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. What if Beth spent less time with her lover and more time with you? do you think that would be a possibility?[0:15:40]</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is not something that I want. I just want that when we do spend time together it is not an issue. If she chooses to spend... If I don't see Beth for two months it is fine, we'll always keep in touch. But most of the time when we do spend time together, her lover is involved. If she chooses not to see me for two months then that is fine, because I don't want to deal with the issues of fighting and jealousies. For the last year this has been going on and for the last couple of months when Beth and I spend one on one time, which is not often- we have time when we spend two, three weekends in a row, but for the most part, it is not that often because it has been a problem for her lover.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So it is not that I want her to spend more time with me. It didn't matter if it was Beth one on one, or with Beth and her lover. But it has gotten to the point where it has become almost every time that we spend time together the girl has something to say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And this last time was sort of the final straw.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, because we were together and she called her four or five times. And we really couldn't enjoy the evening, because I was the topic. "Oh look, she's calling again. Now she wants to know if it is you with me." That is not how I wanted to spend time with her. In fact, I wasn't planning on spending time with Beth, it was supposed to be the three of us. I thought it was a bit much. [0:17:40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it was more than a bit much. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I had it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And what you said, you said that you know what Beth would say, if she told you what the problem is, that she would say, "Don't pay her any mind." Then what would you say in response to that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can't any more. I can't anymore. I can't -  if that would be her response I would honestly tell her I can't ignore it anymore. She's got to realize that I'm a person with feelings, and if she has a problem with her spending time with anyone else or me, it really should be done one on one, not in my presence. Because I don't spend time with you to undermine her or take time with her. I spend time with you because you're my friend. She's making it something that it is not. I feel like she's threatened by it, or jealous by it, or controlling by it. I don't know exactly what her motives are, but to me, it is not fair. It is not fair to me. [0:19:01]</p>

<p>Like I said, I don't see Beth that often, but when I do in the last couple of months, in the last year, it has been a problem.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so, if you explain that to Beth, what do you think she would do or say in response?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure. See, that is where I'm not sure because I'm actually telling her I'm not interested in spending time with you and your lover together. So she might feel "That is my lover and if you're my friend you'll deal with it, just ignore her." And I don't want to do that anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, but on the assumption that you've already told her, "I can't ignore it anymore," she would do or say, you're not sure what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. That I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just because part of what I hear is on the one hand, you've got some idea of how Beth would react initially, but not what she would really do about this conflict. But on the other hand, you expect that Beth knows you well enough that she's going to understand that if there is distance between you she's going to know, "Oh, it is because Tess doesn't want to spend time with me and my lover," there is the conflict there and then that she will respond accordingly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: She'll either ignore it and just let time go by, or she'll say something about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But do you see the contradiction? Just that you are saying that you can't really predict about Beth, but you're expecting Beth to predict about you. Or Beth to understand stuff that you don't explain to her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. OK. So why is that a contradiction?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. I am thinking of it as a contradiction because if you and Beth have been friends for twenty years, but you don't know Beth well enough to say how she would respond to all of this, or you feel like you can't predict or you can't say. Why would Beth be able to understand all of what is going on with you, in you and know without you having to tell her what is going on, what you're feeling, where you're coming from and how to proceed.[0:22:13]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not sure. I just feel that I think she would know it that, the reason why. Because we were supposed to go to a dance in September. She spoke to me during the week. She said, "I'm going to spend quality time this weekend with Fiona." She said, "And it is a good thing the dance is not this weekend. Because I'm going to spend some quality time with her and then the dance is next weekend." </p>

<p>So I told her, "I don't know if I'm going to go." She says, "Oh, we'll see what happens at that time."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I didn't follow that. The dance was in two weekends?</p>

<p>PATIENT: The dance was supposed to be this weekend.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. And she said that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: She is going to spend quality time with her lover.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Instead of going to the dance?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No the dance was cancelled. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you said you think that you're not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, going to go. Because I don't think I'm going to go.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And why is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because we were at the- two, three weeks ago we were at a dance, and I had mentioned it. Oh, I'm looking forward to the dance. And Beth's lover was there and she made a big deal of it because she claims that Beth didn't mention it to her and Beth was planning to exclude her. Again I was caught in an argument. And Beth said, "I did tell you. I told you that the dance was on September." So it became a big issue.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you were not going to go because you didn't want to spend the time with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: With Fiona.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: With Fiona, OK. [0:24:09]</p>

<p> PATIENT: Because I don't think Beth is going to go to the dance without her, not after what happened. Recently. And if she goes, the last time Beth and I went, we went to the dance, it was a dance that was given at a [inaudible 0:24:29] restaurant, and we had a very good time. We stayed until the place closed and we laughed and we had friends. </p>

<p>I know that if she includes Fiona, to this next dance that is September, Fiona is going to start complaining she's tired, or she has to go home.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Although it sounds like your assumptions that it is not if she includes Fiona, it is when she includes Fiona. Seems like you're pretty sure that Fiona will be there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm not going to say, "Is Fiona going?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because that is like, outright telling you that if Fiona is going I'm not going.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I'm afraid that Beth will get angry at me for putting her in between, or putting Fiona in between us. Because Beth is of that personality. She ignores things. "Just ignore her, put it out of your mind."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. It kind of sounds like you feel that if you were to really express to Beth that this is not something that you can just ignore, and that this is really significant because this is about to have a very profound impact on a very important and long term relationship, the one between you and Beth, that Beth won't really understand.[0:26:14] </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. She won't. She really won't. She'll expect me to say, "Pay her no mind. Ignore her." But I can't. I don't want to anymore. I don't think that is what it is all about. You know, people get together and there is conflict or control. We never really had any problems before, as far as spending time together. </p>

<p>You know, now it is... So, my options are, don't say much, just pull away, do your own thing. And if she brings it up, express how you feel and see where it goes from there. Hoping that, in the back of my mind that I don't lose Beth's friendship.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those don't sound like very good options.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is OK. It really is. People do grow apart.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But do you feel like you and Beth are growing apart?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. But she has made a choice to have this woman in her life, with all the conflict and the argument that they go through. The arguing that they go through, so then this is a choice that she is making. It doesn't mean that I should be included in. Maybe that is one form of us growing apart. This is her choice. And my choice is, "she's your lover, I'm not asking you to side with me on her. But if I pull away because of your lover, and you choose to ignore it and let it happen, then we're growing apart."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The part that I am thinking about here is the options you mentioned are that you pull away from Beth and that if she notices you say something and if she doesn't you don't say anything. What about the option of being direct and telling her what is on your mind? </p>

<p>PATIENT: That doesn't feel comfortable to me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why is that?[0:28:44]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because it might seem like -  I think telling Beth, "Look, I don't want to spend that much time with you because you guys argue, the last three months she's made me really uncomfortable, I can't spend time with you without her having some kind of protest or feeling insecure about it. I don't want to deal with it." She won't like it. I'm afraid that she just won't like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If she doesn't like it or she gets angry, then what does that mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That could possibly mean that... I'm not sure.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is your guess?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My guess? One of two things, she'll continue to call on a regular basis and see how I'm doing like we usually do, but she'll respect my wishes and we'll end up growing apart anyway, doing separate things. And I think also, now that I think about it, if I say it that way, and there does come a time when we are together in the same room, all three of us or maybe with other people, that it won't be comfortable that it is in the open that I don't favor this person too much anymore. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, that is the case now, that it is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it has never been really said, outright. You know, not that I don't want to deal with this anymore.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like you're hoping that Beth will understand that somehow by your pulling away from her. The difference being that she will have figured it out without your having to say it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I'm thinking about... Actually, let me ask you a question. Is that something, the way that you are feeling that you would like this to go, is that something that is unique with this relationship to Beth, or has that happened in other relationships before with really feeling like "It will be too uncomfortable if I say this directly, so I'll give them some clues and let the other person figure out what I'm feeling."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes, I would say that is something that I would usually do. Because I find that people really don't, whenever I try to say how I feel, "Oh, that's not true, how could you say that?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is frustrating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I find that frustrating. Or, the first thing out of their mouths, "Don't pay her any mind." You know, that is just the way that I am. You know, I didn't mean anything by it, until maybe about eight years ago I started to say it, "Don't pay me any mind, that's just the way I am." Because I used to be conscious of other people's feelings. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel that way. That is not my intention." But I never used to get that back. I'm tired of hearing this is the way people are, pay them no mind. [inaudible 0:33:12] ignore me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it sounds like that grew out of you that people weren't thinking about your feelings or weren't responding to your concerns.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. I think for the most part they just expect me to deal with whatever occurs with or transpires between me and whoever, and if I speak up and say something, it is not recognized how I'm feeling. They say, "Ah, don't pay her any mind. She'll get over it."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Which is very... not taking you seriously.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. [0:34:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now I'm thinking about here. And you and I working together. If something were going on here that you didn't care for, or that was upsetting to you, I'm wondering if I then would have to figure it out from clues that you give me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think... you're asking questions now. I think this is a different relationship, it is part of your job responsibility to ask me these questions, to get to the root of it I guess, and how it is making me feel, so the dialogue is different. I know that if I were to feel something that bothered me and was negative, if I told you, you would recognize that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is the difference between them, that you would actually recognize my feelings and try to work with it to help me understand why I felt this way, or for you to avoid making me feel that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK. Because when you said that I'm asking you these questions, I thought then, "Well, what if I don't ask the right questions?" If there's something that is going on that is bothering you that I'm just missing, and fail to ask you the questions about that, would you feel like you could tell me about it, or would it be too uncomfortable to have it out in the open, like some other situations that you encounter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think it is a matter of asking the right questions, I think it is just acknowledging my feelings. What is the right question then? What is a wrong question? I don't know. It is just that I know for a fact that whatever it is I'm feeling, you would acknowledge that. Not say to me, "Don't worry about that, that will pass." I don't think you'll ever say that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I hope not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that is the difference.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right. I certainly don't plan to say, "Oh, that is just how I am."</p>

<p>PATIENT: See, that is the difference. And I think that you brought that out, you pointed that out that I am not good with telling people how I feel. I've gotten a lot better from when I was a lot younger from when I used to not say nothing. So I've become a lot more outspoken, but still, I don't... I avoid telling people how I feel because I find that, a lot of people that I have become involved with over my life time, ignore it. Don't acknowledge it or they'll just say, "Don't pay them any mind. Don't pay me any mind. Or that's not true." That is my favorite. "How could you say that?" Well, that is how it made me feel.[0:38:00]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And how does it feel to hearing someone respond with that? "That's not true."</p>

<p>PATIENT: It is frustrating. It is frustrating. It makes me feel like I'm overreacting or they just don't know how to talk about it. It makes me feel a lot of things, depending on what the situation is. So in this case, I knew that I wanted to talk to Beth about it. Something is going to change between us. Right now because it seems I'm just having a problem with this. And I kind of told her, but I can't remember her response. </p>

<p>I said, "You know, this has been going on for a while and this doesn't feel good." She comes back with, "She'll get over it. Don't pay her any mind." I said, "Yeah Beth, but how long am I going to put up with this?" And she ignored me and just went back into what she was going through Fiona with that moment, which was basically just talking about me. </p>

<p>"This is what she's going through, and I don't care, and this is what she wants," that wasn't true, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What wasn't true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That if she and Fiona did breakup that it would effect her more than she was admitting. [0:39:43]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder if you and Beth broke up in a way, grew apart, your friendship sort of evaporate, I wonder if that would effect you more than it seems.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of course. It would. Because Beth is a lot like family and we've spent a lot of time together. It is nice time, good times. She's got her family issues and so do I. But I'm looking at it that if it does come to that, then it is OK. We'll probably still be friends, but not like before as far as spending time together and calling each other. It might not even end up that way. It might end up where she'll have a little time with Fiona, because I know next month Beth is going to Greece for two weeks and for two weeks after that, Fiona is going to Peru for two weeks. So they won't see each other for a month. So that itself might change because when they get back from vacation they'll want to spend time together. </p>

<p>So I'm not sure exactly how all of this is going to transpire. But I know that I don't want to be involved anymore with their conflict. And Fiona in my opinion, maturity and selfishness and her being so open about it to the point that it makes me feel that our friendship is wrong in her opinion. It is too much for her, between Beth and I. That bothers me because Beth and I have 20 years under our belts, and she's just gotten into the picture.[0:41:50]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think in your position I would probably be feeling also, jealousy, given that you've got the 20 year relationship with Beth and as you said, Fiona just came into the picture really, comparatively speaking, but is placing these demands on Beth, that seem, in essence, to come down to having Beth choose between you and her. Choose between you and Fiona.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know if there is jealousy. I know I'm feeling angry about it. Because, like I said, we don't spend all that much time together. We'll have moments when we spend two three weekends in a row, but that is not all the time. For the most part, we talk on the phone. I don't think it is jealousy. It is more like... I wish she was... really, all I can think about is that I wish she wasn't like that. So immature, so controlling. [0:43:24] </p>

<p>She's not the same, she's not on the same level. She has to eat at a certain time, she has to have a certain amount of sleep, everything has got to be on a schedule, on a routine. And that, for a long time we've never been like that between Beth and I or anyone else that we used to hang out with. There are a lot of feelings involved. I just feel like, enough already. I don't know, I think... I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it seems like there are a lot of feelings involved, but you've decided that you're going to deal with that in a pretty tidy way. And just withdraw from Beth and if the friendship goes away, that is OK. Which you will have to help me at some point understand what you mean by OK. Because I've heard you say that you feel angry about it, that Beth is like family and that there will be loss involved and all of that. So I don't know exactly where OK matches up with that, but we can talk about that some more at some point. </p>

<p>It sounds like there are a lot of feelings involved and that the way you decide you're going to deal with those is to say, "OK, we'll make this really tidy." And I wonder where all those feelings go that are attached to this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe accepting the fact that I have to realize that maybe I have to make other choices with how I have to spend my time, and Beth shouldn't be my main focus. Maybe that would be the best thing for me, and maybe that is why I say it would be OK if we grew apart. Because my plan is to balance out my activity with other things that don't involve Beth, because Beth is in a relationship that makes me seem like the bad guy, or her lover doesn't make me feel... or I'm annoyed with the lover for having protest about the way we spend time together.[0:46:04]</p>

<p>So it just makes me realize that maybe I need to find other interests, stay away from that situation, find other things to get involved in. And if in the process we grow apart, then we grow apart. I don't think the friendship will end, but it will change.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yes. And you said just now that you were mad at Fiona for helping create this situation.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It makes me angry. Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder about being angry at Beth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not at all. I'm not angry at Beth because that is how she handles things. "Don't pay her any mind. Ignore it." She'll argue and then two minutes later it is forgotten.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So Helen is one of those folks that you've gotten that response from probably.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. And for Beth to really be concerned about my feelings, it has to be where she knows that I'm totally upset. Emotionally upset. But if I'm hurt, or annoyed, she'd rather just ignore it. Because there has been times when she has been concerned about me. "How are you doing? I'm just wondering how you feel. If you need somebody to talk to, I'm here for you." And she'll listen. But for the most part, she'll just rather sort of ignore it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you feel how?</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far as Beth's way of being?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The fact that Beth, who is your best friend, kind of ignores when you're feeling upset about something. That you have to get really, really very upset in order for her to take your feelings seriously.[0:48:25] </p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd never really given it any thought, but that is the way she is. That is the way she is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you hear that you are using your excuse for her. Which still doesn't speak to your feelings. Because earlier you were saying, "People say that." It is like your feelings aren't being heard, you're being ignored. In a way you're doing that to yourself right now as I'm asking you how it feels that Beth responds this way. And you're saying, "Oh, it is no big deal. That is how she is." </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it is a big deal, because there are times when I really wanted her to be different. But I guess over a lifetime I've learned to accept people- that's totally off- and be accepting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other thing I've been thinking about is what we talked about last time. What you told me about yourself. Which is, you said, "I'm a quitter, I would rather run away from things that are uncomfortable or stressful." You talked about that in terms of your jobs. And it sounds like that is more or less what is happening here too with Beth.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It is the sort of thing you said that you would like to stop having happen in regards to your jobs. [0:50:06]</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do I do? Continue to hang out with them, go through all these changes and talk to her, ask her not to do that anymore? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Let's stop here. We can talk about it more next time. You have [inaudible phrase 0:50:58]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just need to...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So next week again at 6:00?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that working so far?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got down here a little early but see, maybe because the President was in and the FDR had just opened... I don't know, we'll see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: OK.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See you next week.</p>

<p>PATIENT: OK.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Bye bye.</p>

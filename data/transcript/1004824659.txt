<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm deciding to skip the thing on Saturday and go down for this concert. I feel a teeny bit ridiculous, because between the train tickets and the rental car and the hotel room, I'm going to spending 500 bucks to go to a concert, which is absurd. But this is one of my favorite performers, and she hasn't done a tour this year. So it's my only opportunity to see her live until next October. Dave thinks this is a good idea and I should go. (pause) [00:01:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you wanting reassurance from me that it's a good idea? Perhaps?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. (laughs) A little bit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Possibly a little? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine you're feeling a bit anxious about having decided to do something you'd rather do, that's really for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Mmhm. (pause) Yeah. I feel a little bit guilty about bailing on the event and [inaudible [00:02:03], but not really. I feel a little bit hung up on the price tag, but I mean it's (pause) it's certainly something I can afford. So it's not like I'm going to break any budgets. (pause) [00:02:24]</p>

<p>But there's a horrible perfectionist part of my brain that is shrieking "You're spending 500 bucks on a 48-hour trip. Not even that, like 36 hours. It's a huge waste of money, and think of the poor starving children in Africa, and I could've donated that money to a charity, and blah blah blah blah." (pause)</p>

<p>And I hate feeling guilty about everything I do for myself, and maybe this isn't the best example, because 500 bucks actually is a lot of money, but I get this guilt cycle about "that money could be better spent elsewhere. You should donate it, give it away, over getting a $3 cup of coffee, a $1 bag of candy," instead of—right, so. (pause) Yeah. (pause) [00:03:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the reason that I'm hesitant to reassure you is because it seems to me that (pause) it's more to our point to sort of look at the anxiety and—[00:04:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And get me to a point where I can reassure myself, eventually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I understand that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I figure that you understand that. Does it feel like if I'm not becoming supportive, if you understand it that way, that I'm being otherwise? Like mean or critical, or... [00:05:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean, I didn't expect you to actually reassure me that I was making the right decision. I think I've learned better by now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: From me and my ilk.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm looking forward to the concert.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of music is it? I remember it was more... [00:06:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: [inaudible [00:06:03] style has changed a lot over the years. So some of her pieces are kind of Goth industrial, and some verge towards more punk, and some are more folksy. So it's just, it's all over the map. She has a rock opera in three movements telling the Peter Pan story from Wendy's point of view, where Wendy gets to be the protagonist and hero of the story. It's amazing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool. (pause) [inaudible [00:07:15] (pause) [00:07:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just (pause) it's a lot of different pieces that are coming together in my mind right now, and they all center around (pause) femininity and performing femininity, and how femininity is just viewed and scapegoated and just—I don't know if I can make it coherent, but (pause) there's...</p>

<p>So at my party last week, and again at the concert that I'm going to next week, the dress code was, will be, sparkly, glittery. You know, we were (pause) I don't know if you're familiar with Labyrinth, but it stars David Bowie wearing glitter, basically. So we were trying to costume for that theme. [00:08:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was this at your party?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, it was glamorous and it was a Dark Crystal theme, or...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Princess Bride.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Princess Bride, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Dark Crystal would've fit in the theme if we had had time for three movies.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then [inaudible [00:08:31] concert, the title of the tour she's doing is "Return to Fairyland." And so she's been encouraging guests to if not costume, at least dress up. And that's (pause) I don't know. Makeup and glitter and all that stuff were things which in my mind are coded as very femme. And something that I've avoided like the plague for a long time, throughout high school and college and for a couple years after that, that I feel like I'm reclaiming. [00:09:03]</p>

<p>But at the same time, there's ongoing kind of low-level awareness of sexism in my industry at work, and recruiting, and the imbalance between men and women. And kind of how women, in my industry at least, don't present as feminine at the office, even women who are very feminine in their personal lives, because of assumptions about women and femininity, and blah.</p>

<p>And there's also (pause) feminist conversation going on among (pause) authors in the science-fiction world. And I guess it's been going on among fans. But I mostly don't pay attention to fandom, because it's become a stinking cesspool of male privilege and entitlement. But, there's been all of these blog posts on blogs that I read about the "real versus fake geek girl" phenomenon, and what you have to do as a woman who wants to be accepted in the fan community, and how if you show too much skin or wear clothes that show off your breasts or wear too much makeup, you're not a real geek girl, you're just trying to attract a geek man. Because we all know geeks make lots of money because tech boom, whatever. [00:10:23]</p>

<p>And it's just (pause) it's a) [inaudible [00:10:30] in rhetoric and logic, and it's sexist, and it's just tedious. And I'm sick of reading it. And I'm sick of trying to defend my existence in mostly male spaces. And I'm sick of trying to defend my gender presentation. (pause) [00:11:02]</p>

<p>I don't know there's much you can say, except you know, "that sucks," but... (laughs) (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I have the impression that you are (pause). And I guess (pause) one of the impressions that I get about what it's like is (pause) that (pause) I'm not saying this isn't sort of accurate from the reality, I'm just saying my impression is that femininity puts you in a pretty vulnerable position. [00:12:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause) And the really frustrating thing is that my presentation isn't all that far outside the average for women in this country. Right, like if you imagine two overlapping bell curves of traditional masculine traits on one side and feminine traits, and plot women's presentation and men's presentation—I don't know if I'm describing this picture in any—</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get now, I think. Yeah. [00:13:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't even be on the opposite side of center, right, I would still be on the feminine side of the plot. Just not where the expected social norm is. And so if I'm having this much trouble, I can't imagine how much trouble people who are less conformant than I am are having. And it's ridiculous, and it's unnecessary, and it's tiring. (pause) [00:14:20]</p>

<p>I end up spending a great deal more thought than I would like to be spending trying to address the question of "Am I really not feminine in my nature?" Like, is that even a sensical question to ask? Or have I just been trained through bad consequences throughout my entire life that presenting as feminine results in bad things happening, and thus I reject femininity because of some kind of internalized misogyny.</p>

<p>And I guess from a broader cultural perspective, it's a valid question to ask. You know, is rejection of femininity a result of misogyny and patriarchy in our society? Do we escape femininity because of these pressures? But I don't know if that makes sense. [00:15:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It doesn't seem to me that that would—maybe I'm not following you but, it doesn't seem to me that that would be the only reason you or anybody else would—if this were what were going on in the first place—sort of reject or distance themselves from femininity of a certain sort. In other words, I could see it being one reason to internalize misogyny. I can imagine others, such as it's just not fucking safe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not saying that's what it is. But I guess it strikes me that you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) [00:16:05]</p>

<p>And there are certain aspects to the performance of femininity that I enjoy (pause) for short durations of time, for special events. Like putting on makeup for parties or concerts. (pause) And I'm not sure if that means that maybe I would enjoy that more on a daily basis if I were more used to it, like if I didn't have these knee-jerk reactions against feminine presentation. (pause) Or if it really is just, you know, it's fun to dress like [inaudible [00:17:00] for special events. [00:17:02]</p>

<p>(pause) It's funny, Dave cross-dresses sometimes and does drag shows, and doesn't have nearly as much angst about it as I do when I put on makeup.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) [00:18:05]</p>

<p>I wonder if partly you're waiting for or wanting me to comment because there's some things about bringing this up that make you anxious. Such as (pause) in a sense I want to say in not the obvious sense really, such as (pause) not knowing. You're bringing up things you're unsure about.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which I think we already know is not your favorite thing to do. And (pause) to be entertaining some of the possibilities about (pause) [inaudible [00:18:59] femininity. (pause) [inaudible [00:19:05] [00:19:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I guess part of your response to that is to sort of like wait and watch and see what I'm going to say. Among other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mmhm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I would imagine that this is again a desire for me to be supportive and also wariness that I would say things that are (pause) critical, misogynistic, misunderstanding.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. It sounds ridiculous, but mostly I just kind of feel hypocritical and stupid since I'm kind of painfully aware of the fact that I'm wearing a very feminine-styled outfit right now, and so all of my protestations about not feeling particularly femme seem like they're lies, given my attire. [00:20:18]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was not aware that I was over here feeling you're full of shit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I said I was not aware that I was over here feeling you were full of shit.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't say you were.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. It was like "you are." Yeah. But that's [inaudible [00:20:33] I think. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm actually feeling the urge to defend my choice of clothing right now. It's kind of not the point and probably not useful. (pause) [00:21:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whatever you prefer. (pause) [00:22:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I also feel a little bit left out sometimes. Like a bunch of my friends are really, really into nail polish and do these fancy manicures with multiple colors, and draw designs on their fingernails and all this crap. And then post pictures and share them on Facebook, and then they get a million comments. And it's just (pause) I don't know. There's always this—well you know, I could do that. And then I could take part in these conversations with my friends and get positive attention and that would be great. [00:23:18]</p>

<p>But then I think about do I actually want to walk around with painted designs on my hands? No. Do I want to spend the time on this? No. Crap. But I still feel left out, and that doesn't make any sense. Because it isn't actually something I want to do. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know, I (pause) I don't quite see the contradiction in that it could not be something you want to do and still be something you want to be part of.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but... [00:24:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if they were ice fishing, which was a sport you had no interest in -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, maybe you do, I'm just making that up. But -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being out in the cold. No. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know, it'd be sort of fun to be part of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess it seems to me like that, but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it more—is it because it's—part of this feeling is it's not as much something you would be part of in a way? Like the ice fishing, I assume everybody's sitting around looking at the water or something like that. But this doesn't feel like there's a—something like that. [00:25:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) I guess this is the same [inaudible [00:25:45] going on in my head as with spending money on things for me. The question of "are my motives pure, or am I just succumbing to—in the case of small luxuries, am I succumbing to selfishness?" And the question of presentation, and I succumbing to internalized misogyny? And I think in both cases there's a sense of not trusting my own judgment about what's right. [00:26:23]</p>

<p>I don't know, maybe that's a stretch to draw that connection, but... it made sense in my head. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I can sort of see that there's confusion about trying to sort out what you want or what you feel you should do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) [00:27:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And (pause) another way it seems to be part of this is, to an extent, is the (pause) critical [inaudible [00:27:28] (pause) [inaudible [00:27:38] per se versus a reaction, because of the [inaudible [00:27:43] reaction to something that you want for yourself but it's expensive and so forth. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's an argument that I've heard made by many feminists of my generation, which is if you're a woman and you're successful in technology or science, or not just stem fields, any male-dominated fields, so finance, law, anything like that, then you have a responsibility to younger women to kind of push the boundaries of what type of female presentations are acceptable in your workplace. Like push your workplace to be more accepting of feminine presentation. [00:28:34]</p>

<p>And this is probably more an issue in stem fields than like law. Just the culture of the field. And so, you know, you should be presenting as feminine, and you should be wearing dresses to work, just to prove that you can. To set an example for younger people in the field.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like blaze the trails, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. (pause) Part of me finds that argument a little bit compelling; part of me doesn't want anything to do with it because it seems awfully prescriptive and unpleasant. [00:29:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) My impression is that (pause) like with the coffee, it's clear you want the coffee. The concert, it's pretty clear you want to go to the concert. But the nail polish, doesn't sound like that's something you want. Maybe it's buried a little deeper, desire for it, but it (pause) unlike the [inaudible [00:30:23], I don't hear a sense of like you're wanting it and condemning yourself for it. [00:30:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At least not, again, not through consciously. It may be there and buried more deeply or something. Or maybe it's not there. Because it doesn't seem—yeah. And then I guess the kind of femininity I think you're talking about more generally, it sounds like you're kind of genuinely confused, like you just don't know (pause) you don't know what you actually want or some of what feels like you apart from (pause) how vulnerable you'd feel or why you'd feel like you were wearing or doing whatever. [00:31:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) So yeah, is it that I have some internalized misogyny going on? Is it that I just don't believe I'll be taken seriously if I present as feminine, and so I don't as a defense mechanism? Is that I was never taught how to style clothes or wear makeup properly and so I feel insecure about my ability to pull it off without looking like a clown? I don't know. It could be all of the above. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, my predictable suggestion is keep talking. [00:32:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So (pause) it also makes me wonder (pause) do you experience sort of not knowing or feeling unsure in this sort of way as a gendered thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean by that question? [00:33:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine there's a kind of stereotype out there of like, men know and are sure and are rational, and women you can be like unsure and kind of -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Flighty. Ditzy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Probably, yep. (pause) Just remembering the last guy I was with telling me I approach relationships like a man, and that was a problem. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a sense what made you think of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hm?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have a sense what made you think of that? I mean, was it a reaction to what I said?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Indirectly, maybe. You mentioned something about stereotypes about men and women, and (pause) yeah. (pause) I didn't know this assessment was entirely based on stereotypes about men and women. [00:34:21]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And stereotypes being the connecting link, I think.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Sure. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know. For all that, for whatever deep-seated reasons or not so deep-seated, as the case may be, but whatever reason I feel like I've rejected femininity, I don't actually want to embrace masculinity either, and (pause) you know, the thing Alyssa said, or my sister was telling me, "Gosh, you're such a guy. You don't wear makeup." And just the last particular example coming from my sister was I'm too manly because I don't pluck the hairs on my toes. And I find that really offensive. Like I just (pause)... [00:35:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What offends you about it? It's not that I can't imagine things that would offend you, it's more like I can imagine a few of them, and I'm just not sure which one is getting to you. [00:36:03]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) I think it's that (pause) I really dislike having my position as a woman in this society questioned or dismissed because I'm not fitting the center of the average way that women are expected to behave in our society. Or behave, dress, look, as a whole. That whole nexus of (pause).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Identity.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I mean (pause) yeah. Right, like not waxing my toes doesn't suddenly give me male privilege. It doesn't mean that I'm not a minority in my workplace. It doesn't mean that like I don't have to worry about sexism and misogyny on a daily basis. Right, like (pause). [00:37:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Of course my sisters have all kinds of—they have their own issues going on, so they shouldn't pick on me too much. But that really was ridiculous, how they were like "Look at your toes, they're really ugly. You look like a man." (pause) I didn't know toe waxing was a thing, but apparently it is, and you can get it done at beauty salons. [00:38:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The thing in my mind is like—the word was you're feeling—a little refugee-ish there. I mean, on one hand, you're saying, yeah, it doesn't really get me all the things those folks in other camps have. And at the same time, "I didn't know that was a thing" in a way that also makes me think you feel kind of left out there, too. [00:39:23]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think it's a bad thing that I didn't know about the thing. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I didn't know if you were feeling wishful of that or not, but maybe not. Not really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I could go on a rant about the way societal beauty standards keep moving to become more and more impossible. It's, you know. (pause) [00:40:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's like (pause) [inaudible [00:40:32].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like so it's not enough you have to pluck your eyebrows and shave your legs and wax your upper lip. Now you've got to wax your toes too. What other crazy things can we force women to do in order to keep women in their place in this country? I don't know, I feel like I'm verging into a rant-ish territory here, but (pause). So much time and energy goes into beauty rituals that—and it's time and energy that could be spent on any number of other things, but because of society, we've demanded that women invest time and energy in these beauty rituals. It's depressing thinking about. [00:41:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mmhm. Like the wasted hours that 00:41:27].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And [inaudible [00:41:33].</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause) [00:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean, I really think your point about the rant (pause). I don't know, I was sort of tempted to say [inaudible [00:42:45] of ranting is a safer position. A safer activity, I guess. I don't know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Being angry feels less vulnerable than talking about my feelings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something like that, [inaudible [00:42:59]. But (pause) I can still understand why you're angry with that. [00:43:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. (pause) [00:44:14]</p>

<p>I guess part of me, part of my angst is I feel like (pause) at least among the central circles I belong to—I have many of them, there's like the alum circle, my church circle, and certainly among my queer friends and my feminist friends, I feel almost like an imposter for saying that I don't actually think of myself as very femme. I don't like very femme presentations. But I like wearing jewelry, and that's traditionally seen as a very femme thing, and so (pause) I definitely feel like there's peer pressure on me that if I want to identify as less femme or butch or hard femme or whatever label, that I have to change the things that I enjoy. Like stop wearing jewelry, or whatever. [00:45:15]</p>

<p>(pause) And I guess, from a kind of societal perspective—not societal, it's more [00:45:27], but looking at it through a critical lens, I can see why that pressure is there. But (pause) it kind of sucks to be [00:45:38] by it. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like if I'm going to go around wearing earrings and bracelets and necklaces and things, then I feel like I should go whole hog and also do other things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wax your toes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe not that far, but you know, put on eye makeup every day, at least, or something. And (pause). [00:46:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep. Thursday, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then next week I assume we won't be doing Thursday? (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But will you be here on Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I will be here on Monday. Yeah. You too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. See ya.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yep.</p>

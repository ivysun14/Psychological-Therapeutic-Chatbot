<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: So this week was actually kind of nice in that Chet was out sick Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. And I was so happy, which was kind of sad, but I was really happy. And I finished school, which was good — for the semester. And today I had one of these — like in the fancy complicated computer AV rooms, when we call on someone to repair, somebody has to kind of sit with the person. So someone was fixing [in the middle of the tables] and basically they only talk to me probably like once an hour, but I need to be there four hours (inaudible).</p>

<p>[01:05.3]</p>

<p>So, I don't know, yesterday I ran into a former co-worker of mine. That was, oddly, someone I've worked at two jobs with. I worked with him at help desk jobs, he's a co-op student. Then I left that job and went somewhere else, and when I came to the library he was there in IT. And it was like "hi, you!" Then he left and he's now at this place and he's like a fancy manager and he's got his own office. He was just like really happy, like not miserable at work, kind of jovial. I'm like oh, hmmmm, I see how this is.</p>

<p>[01:59.6]</p>

<p>Then this morning, when I'm coming into work, I ran into another former co-worker. It was someone who, we were working in the library together up until about three weeks ago and she quit because she got a new job. And she just looked radiant. I'm thinking crap, I kind of see where this is going. Leaving Brown makes you happy. So I was like okay, I have my resume half-edited. I decided to start going online looking up like financial aid, just the student loan stuff, and how much I have left. So I need six classes to finish, which would be — I could do it, if I magically quit today or was laid off today, I could finish it over the summer semester and fall semester, and then be done. Or two semesters, whatever. I'm so close. Tuition for all of that would be $20,000.</p>

<p>[03:23.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. Like $10,000 a semester, essentially?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's per credit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like 18 credits, and it's something like $1,300 per credit. Yeah. So one of the forms I was looking on kind of weirdly — you know, I'm an independent student because my parents don't contribute, they've never. But the form asked about the age of your oldest parent. And I'm like, that's kind of weird, oh well, whatever. And so I called my parents and I asked my mom how old she was and then reviewed all of that, I was filling out a financial aid form, and then it all just went downhill from there. It was such a bad idea.</p>

<p>[04:19.6]</p>

<p>Because first she was like "What are you doing?" I'm like "I'm applying for financial aid." She's like "You're not going to get financial aid. You can't get financial aid. You make too much money. Why are you doing that? Why are they asking you these things?" I was like "I don't know mom. It's a form. I'm filling it in. It's the federal government. I have no idea." So we did that for a little while. Then she was asking "Well, why are you doing this now?" And I told her that I was trying to figure out how quickly I could finish and how much it costs and everything. I said "Well, if I wasn't working, I'd be done by December." And she was like "What do you mean, if you're not working? You have to be working. You can't just not work. What about your education benefit?" I'm like "Mom, I'm just looking at some forms. I haven't quit my job."</p>

<p>[05:22.5]</p>

<p>And she was just super freaked out and just going on like basically "The Brown education benefit is so good, and you can't just not work" and that I just can't quit my job because "you can't." And I was just like "I have to go, bye" and hung up and felt so much regret. It's like I'm not going to talk to my parents at all about anything to do with the Brown restructuring because I was pretty sure the conversation would just go like that. And having gotten that taste, now I really really don't want to talk to them about it. It's hard. That's a lot of debt to take on. I mean, that's just the tuition. That's not my rent or food or whatever. So I'm assuming it will probably be more like $30,000 or $40,000 to kind of —</p>

<p>[06:38.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right, right — to get through. Tuition costs (inaudible at 06:43.1).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But then I'd be done. I literally can't advance anymore without an MLS. The only way I could advance would be through IT, and IT is definitely getting job cuts. So, no. And technically I'm not part of the IT structure, so like, whatever.</p>

<p>[07:19.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I've just done IT because it pays well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You want to be a librarian, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I'm kind of like, a librarian [if I finish, fucking do it]. This girlfriend of mine, Mandi, basically she has her MLS, and within a week of putting in her resume and planning for things, she started getting interviews. I talked to her a little bit about how she is also black and also plus-size, and I just really feel like going on job interviews those are two negatives, almost always.</p>

<p>[08:17.8]</p>

<p>And she's like "Yes, but they don't know that until you get to your interview usually. At that point they'll probably be like 'holy shit, you're amazing, let's hire you.'" I'm like, okay. I don't know. I feel like I just am so — this Brown transition is taking forever, and it's just going to continue to take forever, and the layoffs are going to continue to hang over our heads. I [get in away like] hoping to get laid off is probably more financially sensible in a strange little way because I might get severance, which would be a lot. It would be 30 weeks of pay.</p>

<p>[09:32.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. That would be the whole time you're in school.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Basically, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Depending on when it happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I could collect unemployment, I think, the whole time I'm in school. At any rate, it would be pretty sweet. (pause) But I also — the interminable waiting is interminable. (pause) And I just, I don't know. My mom is like "You just need to stay there for two more years." I'm like, oh God, no, I don't want to stay here for two more years. I could try and find another job at Brown, but I feel like it's kind of pointless for me right now to move to another Brown job.</p>

<p>[10:46.3]</p>

<p>It wouldn't be in the library system, because there are no job openings in that or anything. So it wouldn't be in the library system, so I wouldn't be doing what I actually want to do. It would either be being a department secretary — like I would probably be a secretary working in IT at a help desk, or something like that. That's what I'm good at, where most of my job skills are. And I still would have a hard time doing my coursework, and there would still be like "I have to leave work early" and run around and this and that. Even looking at online courses, there are more restrictions on them that I realized, and I can't get any of my requirements done online.</p>

<p>[11:48.5]</p>

<p>It looks like I can only actually take — I should probably read it again — but it seems I can only take two online courses a year, which seems weird. Very little completely online only degree as well. That's something that I want to do. (pause) But I just feel like, I'm really sure I don't want to be in this job anymore, but I know I'm going to end up having a library degree and working in a library. But the getting there part feels really hard. I don't feel like there are a lot of great options.</p>

<p>[12:53.6]</p>

<p>Quitting my job is not the best idea. Taking out student loan debt is not a great idea, although I feel like it's kind of inevitable to take on some amount of debt. (pause) I don't want to talk to my parents about it, except that I do want to talk to my parents about it. I would like some advice and would they co-sign a loan with me, et cetera. But I don't want to talk to them about it because they are going to freak out. (pause) I think I want someone else's parents to talk to. (Laughter) That's what I want. I would like someone else's parents to talk about "Well, do you think this is a good idea?" and blah blah blah, and then talk to my own parents. But that's not an option.</p>

<p>[14:06.5]</p>

<p>Another hard part is that one of my friends put herself in crazy debt to go to communications school. So she's like "Don't go into debt to go to school. It's the worst thing ever." And I'm like "well, to be fair, getting a communications degree was stupid." (laughter) I mean, I never really said that to her but to be frank, that was a dumb idea. You don't need a communications degree to write for newspapers or whatever. Newspapers are a dying field. And what her degree was in was basically newspaper. So I'm like yeah, that was a bad idea.</p>

<p>[14:56.4]</p>

<p>But I think the problem was not entirely — the problem is that you made a really dumb choice, not that debt is bad, but also — I don't know why she, well, whatever. (pause) And it's also hard because my undergraduate debt, my grandmother paid off a big chunk of. When she sold her house, she took money from it. My grandmother in Sweden. And she paid off her grandkids' student debt.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's nice.</p>

<p>[15:49.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was great. My mom is kind of like ["P.S., foom!"] I'm like, what just happened? So I haven't been paying a student loan debt since a decade because that happened. So I really don't have a sense of it anymore. You know, I've got to not — like the last time I was handing over all my money to Sallie Mae, or whatever, I was also 25 and working a super-crappy job and living in a crack house apartment. So it's a little different. But then again I'm like, I've also not been a poor student for a really long time, so I don't know that deliberately impoverishing myself or (inaudible at 16:53.1) is going to be fun either, because I'm really used to disposable income.</p>

<p>[17:00.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like it's kind of hard to think through.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just like all these branching if-thens, like I could wait to see if I get laid off. If I get laid off, I could do this. If I don't get laid off, I could do this. Do you know what I mean? I feel like there's not —</p>

<p>[17:46.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, the tree sort of expands a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. (pause) And I also feel kind of ridiculous at this age being like well, I don't want to do something that my parents think is a really bad idea. But on the other hand, they've already been through grad school. (laughter) So it's kind of like well, you guys did that and you paid off that debt in a completely different situation. But if there were reasons they thought it was a really bad idea, other than just freaking out, I would want to know. But I think all I can really get is my mom freaking out, or my dad freaking out as well. Even though they supported my brother quitting his job to get a Master's — well, a Ph.D. program and then a Master's. Went to UCLA for five years, I think.</p>

<p>[19:18.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was in a Ph.D. program (inaudible at 19:25.6).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In engineering?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that's the funny thing. He was in the Ph.D. degree program in organic chemistry. It was kind of a science program. So he went from a fancy job to grad school. The summer before he did (inaudible at 19:58.8). But he didn't get his Ph.D. — one, because he had a really hard time focusing on what he wanted to do because he's like "everything is so awesome", and two, he had a major mental health breakdown which ended in him running away, ending up in Georgia, and also jumping off a bridge.</p>

<p>[20:31.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. But we couldn't find him. He disappeared for several days.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You guys must have been terrified.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because my parents are not good with computers, obviously, I was talking to his friends and gathering whatever digital data I could to try and figure out —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Where he went, where he used his bank card, something like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And also afterwards it was interesting and frustrating because he was hearing voices, and he kind of knew. He was like "well, they wouldn't stop" so that was really hard. But he also knew what to do to not be tracked, which was take out a big wad of cash and then not use any of your cards, which is what he did. He was in Reno and then he was in Georgia.</p>

<p>[21:40.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But did he do that because he was paranoid or because he just didn't want to be tracked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He didn't — it's kind of unclear. He didn't want anyone to follow him. Not that — I don't think because he felt that people were following him, but he didn't want his friends or family to know where he was and follow him. What kind of was going on was he was hearing all these voices and they wouldn't stop. He didn't know what to do. He felt like (pause) — I don't know. It's like he didn't want to talk to us, I think, for fear of worrying but also because he just — he knew the whole time they were delusionary voices, but they kept on going, being louder. He's just like "I don't know what to do. I'm exhausted." So when he off — jumped off a bridge, he was hospitalized. After he was stabilized, after like a day or two, he called my parents and was fine with my mom picking him up and him staying with my parents for about a year, living in our house.</p>

<p>[23:28.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This was when he lived with them for that year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. Then he went back to school. And what he decided to do is, he went back to school and was like "well, basically I'm either going to — I need to figure out if I'm ending with a Master's or am I going to do a Ph.D." And the answer was, he's like "I just need to get my Master's and stop." So that's what he did. It was when he was at UCLA that he met Margaret, so that was good. I think he was finishing or just finished the Master's when they met.</p>

<p>[24:22.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does this kind of scariness hang over the family, especially around these sorts of decisions?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) My parents won't talk about it, basically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That usually means it hangs over the family more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was basically just kind of hanging there awkwardly, a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine terrifyingly for everybody.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So he disappeared one other time when he was in undergrad, I think his senior year. But it was for like a day. And what he decided to do was he went to the city (inaudible at 25:22.3) wanted to go across the this bridge for some reason and then wanted to sleep in a park, just like out.</p>

<p>[25:33.6]</p>

<p>And after doing that, he called his girlfriend and our family, like "I'm in the City." And then I think he actually just went back to Manchester on the bus or something. I don't think anyone went to get him. But yeah, it just hangs over a lot. The idea of not working, completely, really freaks my parents out. The idea of my brother and I not having a job, they get — I don't want to say irrationally worried because [my mom has been employed.] But it's like I can't talk to them about it. They're just "But you need to have a job." I'm like "Right, well —". "But you have to have a job. But you have to have a job." It just doesn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>[26:43.5]</p>

<p>(Pause) So I always feel like any kind of big decision that I think about or that I want to do, what my mom is thinking is "this is like that time Clark had a mental breakdown and ended up in Georgia." Even though she said — she's very weird about it because she flew down there and she stayed in one of those hotels where businessmen stay for like a month. So they were there for like a week. I talked to her every night and she was like "I really like this hotel. They have free wine every evening." And I'm like "Okay, mom." It was kind of weird. She was like "It's very nice. Clark can't have any, of course, because of all the medication." I'm like, "Yeah, that's true." She's like "I think I like Georgia. Maybe we should visit here sometime when it's not — " I'm like "Yes, mom. You don't like Georgia, though." It was very surreal.</p>

<p>[27:57.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds very surreal.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was. Because I'm like "You don't like Georgia." I think she was just so happy that my brother was alive, and she was drinking free wine every night, that she was just odd in many ways. But I think my mom is basically like, "She really wants to do something. Holy crap. She must be just crazy to want to quit her job. There can't be any other reason." (pause) And her other thing was that there is no way for me to complete library school unless I am working at Brown and getting the tuition benefit, which isn't true. But she's very strong.</p>

<p>[29:13.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I get the sense that for her, certainly, and maybe partly because of that to some extent for you, there's this thermo-nuclear anxiety that gets triggered and just blows everything up, including the ability to think clearly and rationally about it. Or, I mean, as clearly and rationally as we generally think about things, you know.</p>

<p>[29:48.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I kind of feel like I want to prepare her some slides and spreadsheets and just e-mail them to her, and then not talk to her for a week, and then talk to her. I've already planned not answering any phone calls from my parents this weekend, because it's just not going to go well, which will probably make them crazy but I don't care. And I think even if I was like "look at this beautiful, well-thought-out financial plan," her reaction would still be to freak out. That something must be going wrong, like no matter how sane and rational I presented it, she would still be "You're crazy."</p>

<p>[30:39.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My hypothesis, which is very tentative since I've never met her or talked to her, is that part of the way this works is that it's not that she's anxious, it's that you're crazy. Does that sound —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Like any kind of — my mom does not like change, but she would never — it's not that she doesn't like change, it's just that we're all just doing it wrong. And she has already figured out the correct way to do it and we're just doing it wrong and that's stupid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. I think part of her definiteness about things is that she has no concept that she herself could possibly be anxious, that anything anywhere ever could be ambiguous.</p>

<p>[31:45.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I definitely think she didn't perceive herself as freaking out or being anxious when I talked to her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if that's what's happening, she's freaking out, you must be crazy. Like that's the only way that explains why she's so concerned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much does this kind of feed back to you? In other words, I guess what I'm really asking is how much sort of, you know, through whatever channels our parents keep affecting us until we're forever, does talking to her today, not just become an unpleasant thing in itself, which it clearly was, but also really freak you out?</p>

<p>[32:51.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It freaks me out every time. (pause) Because I feel like I end up having to rehash everything, and for a good half the conversation she just doesn't hear anything I say. Sort of repeating everything, which I hate doing. And then we just start arguing about facts, which is never good, and I feel so — it's really stressful and I feel that any wrong phrasing or word could just set my mom off in a new "I can't believe that you said X."</p>

<p>[33:53.1]</p>

<p>And also I feel like at least the first — I always have these couple of conversations to go through, and the first conversation she doesn't listen to anything I say. It's kind of like I'll say something and I'm not sure if she literally didn't hear me or if she just figuratively didn't hear me because she'll just keep on going on. Or she just won't stop talking. I'm like "Mom, I just wanted to say." (pause) And I feel like really, not really quite infantilized but I feel like — I don't know if I feel like a teenager, you know, like I'm arguing over curfews except that we didn't. (pause)</p>

<p>[35:08.7]</p>

<p>I just feel like whatever I say to her, she instantly discounts. Any arguments I have, any reasons I have, her knee-jerk response is "No, it's just a bad idea." I'm frustrated because I talked to her and my dad at one point and said "If I need to take out loans for school, would you co-sign, would you help me with them?" and they said yes. So I'm like "Okay, I want to do that now." And now it's a really bad idea.</p>

<p>[36:05.5]</p>

<p>I try to explain to them like, I don't think I can do two classes next semester. I think I would lose my mind. I mean, right now, one class a semester is more than enough. (pause) I don't want to be a brat and be like "But you said you'd give me money for school." But on the other hand, I'm like "You said you'd give me money for school, and if you're not going to, I actually can just take a loan." Not that I want to, but I could. (pause) I also know if I just was like "Well, fine, I'm taking out loans," my mom would be really hurt and I don't want to just take out a crap ton of loans. Not that my credit is good enough for it, but even so.</p>

<p>[37:19.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think you also really want to have parents who you can talk to reasonably about this kind of stuff. And it sounds like, actually I think I heard you say before, you're pretty frustrated that you can't.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's really crazy that I haven't talked to them about anything to do with work (inaudible at 38:09.1). I haven't talked to them about the layoff possibilities, any of it. Whenever I think about that, I'm like wow, but I want to talk to them about it. I feel weird hiding the information from them, but I don't think I can have a conversation with them about it. I think I'll have a really miserable conversation with them, and I'd rather put it off. Putting it off longer doesn't really help, in a way, but I'm almost like fuck it, I don't care, I don't want to have this conversation with them.</p>

<p>[38:57.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I imagine it makes kind of a difference to — I mean, sure, putting off something you have to tell them doesn't make that future conversation any better, but it does sound like there are ways to tell them less instead of more, like it's troubling but it's also easier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Part of what makes it easier is that, I know part of how that conversation would go, especially from my dad, is like that I must be wrong, that they haven't announced layoffs yet. The work situation doesn't make any sense and it's creepy and confusing, and I'm pretty sure my parents would insist that I just don't understand it.</p>

<p>[39:59.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Sure, I can understand your frustration about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really — (pause). I really don't want them to — and that feels really infantilizing for them to be like "Oh, you just don't understand."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of course. We're going to stop for now. I'm sorry. I feel like I cut you off sort of in mid-thought.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I mean, yes but no. It's kind of the same thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. We'll talk more about this thought on Tuesday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hopefully I won't have talked to my parents by then.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We just got back from Aruba.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Aruba?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's why we have tans.  Last week, perfect weather down there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have amazing tans.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mine's peeled because I refused to put on the lotion.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I put on the lotion.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Went for 8 days and the weather was an average of about 82 degrees.  And the only time it rained at all was, uh, in the early morning a few drops, but you could walk right through and you don't even realize it actually.  You look overhead, the sun is out and the only reason there's a cloud off to the side, there's tradewinds there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Was that the first time you've been to Aruba or have you been before?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Thirty eight and a half years.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A long time ago.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, that's right, our honeymoon.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> On our honeymoon, so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So it was a second honeymoon.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well sort of, it changed.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Second time there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, okay I get it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we enjoyed it.  The sun was nice.  The biggest decision we gotta make is do we, there was a lot of pools all over the place and we were fairly close to the ocean.  Do we go to the pool or do we go to the beach?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Such a decision.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Tell me where you're going and I'll meet you there.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And one of the pools we had an ultimately tough decision, the pool was right near the ocean, so the pool, the ocean, and then they have a, uh, uh bar on either side.  You go to this one on the left or do we go to the one on the right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> What a life.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we had to get out of the water.  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah it was only a week or walk away.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we had to get out of the water.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There was another pool in another part of the development you could swim right up and have something to eat or drink.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so we got, yknow, a hotdog, a sandwich and a drink.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Very luxurious.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> This was like a time share.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Time share, swap.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We change, yeah we had -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Not a resort per se, but a time share?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It was a resort, but -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It's like 5 different entities divvying, there's 5 different resorts interconnected, 2 of them are all inclusive and 3 are time share.  So but you can use the restaurants, the facilities.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And the newest carrier where we stayed at, which we had no choice, we took what they assigned us, they're actually selling them that's there as well as selling time shares.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not buying, but I'd love to.  It's beautiful.  Different pace of life and people are so friendly down there.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> People are laid back and consertive.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I guess it could have been worse.  You could have come back to white stuff.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We came back to dead battery in the car.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh no, yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That was the worst part of it, that's all.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's all right.  Somebody jumped it, we have triple A, so we had a jump and we were able to get home and all the better.  It's not the worst.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Not bad at all.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm thinking that it was a good vacation. You really felt well.  You both felt good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was good actually being out.  Vacations locally I wind up trying to do too much.  When I go away like we did here, then you're restricted.  You really can't, I didn't have, I had access but not really to the computer that we had one of the buildings you have to pay for something borrowed, too much but I did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So did you find yourself able to relax?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Sit down and get a good sleep and you weren't pressured to get up in the morning.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, pretty much.  I always get up, uh, a little early.  I didn't get up as early as I would here, but when the sun starts peeking through I, I have to get up.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So you felt that things were pretty even?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I uh -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He has no plans for the day, like he gets in the pool.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's good.  Like today or here at home I'm trying to decide, do I want to go to an auction or the flea markets, do I want to go to the store.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, yknow why I'm asking that, if you were able to relax while you were away, right?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Only because we've been worried about your being a little hyper at times here.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Still is.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Here at home.  But when you're away -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Much better sleep away.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You were able to slow down -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And kind of just relax.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Not too much on the mind and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A lot less to think about because you don't have all these possible, the biggest ultimate plan is to go to the beach or the pool.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But yknow what?  I mean, I guess, yknow, being retired and being here you can choose priorities in a more laid back way at home too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, I can.  I can.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a choice.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Like one of our friends [NAME OTHER], that, uh, that when you retire every day's almost the same, just about, yknow, there's no schedule.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You have 6 Saturdays and a Sunday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You have 6 Saturdays and one Sunday.  Sunday's still Sunday.  But the other days, Tuesday, Thursday, what difference does it make.  You don't have to get up to go to work.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Like there's no boss or no.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Nobody over my head.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, there's certain things I guess you have to do, like you've got to pay your taxes and do all those things -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes you do, its your responsibility to do it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But, yknow, you're your own boss.  Yknow, when you were finding yourself pressured to do so much, it really was pressure from inside.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, when you're working, uh, you have more responsibilities.  Schedules, deadlines, yknow, you have to complete whatever you're doing by a certain period of time or -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You can still put yourself on a schedule.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I try to.  When I get up in the mornings and I'm generally up before her, I try to, I'm a morning person, she's an evening person.  I try to do things in the morning, put mail away, yknow, read newspa, I actually read the newspaper, I do all the puzzles, I've read all, yknow, the sports, I read the business, I read the main section, I read what's going on, and then I go on to the puzzles and I usually do the sudoku puzzles, then I'll do the, um, the, uh, cryptoquote, I always do that, religiously, and I get them all.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's if he stays home, if you don't go to.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, if I go somewhere early, generally, when I come home I look forward to doing the puzzles and catching up on the news.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And sleep.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I catch, sometimes if I do get up early, then I will maybe take, uh, uh, a little afternoon nap just before dinner.  So I will get my sleep, but, uh, I don't know if I'm sleeping, it's not really a concern, but I don't sleep thoroughly through the night.  But maybe that's because I took a nap sometimes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I mean, when you say not sleeping.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't usually sleep, 5, I don't sleep 4 or 5 hours straight through.  I sleep 3 hours, kind of awake, awaken, then I fall back asleep.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> How long are you awake during that period?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes 10 minutes, sometimes an hour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is it more often 10 minutes, or more often an hour?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Um, both.  Sometimes I'll be concerned maybe, I'm not even sure that's the reason, but what I've planned the next day or 2 or something has just occurred that day.  So, yeah, once in a while I'll get up.  I had a crazy nightmare about a month ago.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, he has them all the time.  But this is nothing new.  When he has them, he screams.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And this has been there for years?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.  And he just screams.  That was when we were away actually.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Was it?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That was a couple weeks ago.  I thought it was a month ago.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And he was thrashin, and I could have, usually he mumbles but it's real loud, and this time it was so clear.  I can't remember now what it was.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't remember at all.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He was cussing something was happening.  It's always something happening.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, so.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But then I found out one night when his mother was here a couple years ago, she does the same thing.  It's like, oh my gosh, he's gonna wake everybody up, and then I went upstairs and it was her.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That doesn't happen that often.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Just every once in a while.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You go in spells it seems.  Like sometimes it'll be every night and then other times for months I don't hear him.  He's loud enough that if I'm downstairs I can hear him.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You can hear it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's just him.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know if I've watched something on TV or who knows.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Used to be you were dreaming about something on the job.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, something at work.  Not depression so much but things, that's [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You were yelling someone stole something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's what his last dream was.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was somehow behind a counter and I remember part of the dream, uh, some kind of a store, it wasn't even my store, I was renting some space in some store, and somebody was stealing stuff, then I woke up.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He was working the flea market.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was probably my flea market and I was probably.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Behind the counter selling.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was probably talking to somebody across the way or something and then somebody came over and was stealing whatever I had out, something crazy.  Yeah, maybe that's what it was.  I don't know.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sure seems like you're doing pretty well. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Other than that, I feel pretty good.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He has days I find that he will just, like at the holidays, even your brother was there, or even one day even when we were away, he just is all self centered type thing.  It's like all about him, so no matter what I do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, it's not so much that I know what's going on.  I like to have things planned ahead, even when I'm on vacation.  And I, she, most of the time, can't think 2 or 3 things down the road.  She can only have 1 thing in her mind at a time.  Like if I'm going to the store, then I'm like after the store, where are we going to go and where are we going to eat, yknow.  I have to, next thing in mind and the thing after that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'm relaxed.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she doesn't think that far ahead.  But I've always been like that, so it's nothing different, I don't think.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But it's the way you approach it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, sometimes I anticipate.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> You get very mean at times.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, what happens, I anticipate you reading my mind, thinking, oh, we're going to do, after we go to the store we're going to go to the movies or whatever, yknow, so -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So each of you are kind of anticipating the other.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I usually look ahead.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She just lives for the moment.  And I, uh, look ahead to what I'm going to do next, what I'm going to do after that.  So I'm, even when we go away and drive down to Florida, I have it in my mind on the day before that I'm going to get up at a certain time, which is usually five o'clock.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, you get up, we're leaving at five.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We're leaving the house at five.  I don't want to leave at five oh five.  I want to leave at five.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, if we leave at five oh two, he says we're late.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So with that anticipation I get up in enough time to get ready for five.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So what happens with me many times is as it approaches time to wait, awaken, I'm already awake cause I don't want to get up late.  And so I can get on the road.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You wake up before your alarm.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But then there's not a relaxed trip down to Florida because everything has to be.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I want to eat breakfast until we get to, past Washington D.C. where the traffic is.  So I gear myself and she sleeps through it, 'til I get to a certain point then I can relax.  Now I've gotten through the traffic.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have a very regimented way of looking at it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, but only because probably because of work and schedules and -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Although the fact that you were able to go on vacation and not be as pressured and not be as -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Not as, but he still.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I was, I really wasn't.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, but there were times -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I didn't care what we were doing at what time.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I can't do as much, well, we're going to this and this and this, well, of course we're taking the bus, well no [PATIENT NAME] we don't even know where the bus stop is -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well in my mind there was a bus.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So we kept walking, walking, walking, and then we ended up -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Taking a cab cause we couldn't find a bus stop.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Taking a cab cause we couldn't find a bus stop.  But it was like, no, we're doing the bus.  And then when all of a sudden he realized, okay, we don't know where the bus stop is, then we got the cab.  But we had walked like over a mile to get to a place where we could get a cab.  So it's, there's no, once he sets his mind to do something, there's no alternative.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's flexibility.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have things set in my mind, it seems that, sometimes I'm unaware or I think that she can read my mind. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And obviously, uh, we're not always on the same wavelength.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But I don't think that's that unusual.  Why would you, yknow, after all this many, this many years I would think you would kinda know what I -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Because at times, at times he becomes mean as opposed to misunderstanding. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It  gets very nasty.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess I can't understand how you didn't anticipate.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> How can you think like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right. But then, but then when you look back on it, it may be a fault that you're not communicating as clearly to start.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, this is true.  Yeah, in my mind I thought I'd kind of mentioned it.  But sometimes I do and sometimes you don't listen.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, sometimes you mentioned it to our daughter and he thinks he told me too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and that's happened.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Which we all do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I guess if I want the kids to know, like her.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I guess it's, yknow, it's trying to prevent the anger from coming up by making sure, even if you're repetitive, if you can remember making sure you're communicating and if it's a repeat, oh well, then at least yknow that you said it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I will have, because even if I tell you a day or 2 in advance what my plan is, I usually have my plan for the next day, I'm going to go here, Delaware Thursday, or I'm going to go to New York on Monday or whatever.  Then she'll say, what day did you say you were going to go, yknow.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] it's not that I don't tell her.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Sometimes he tells me, sometimes he thinks he's told me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you keep a calendar?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.  It's up here in my head. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's not like in a computer or?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she does, she's very, we have a big calendar with the little dates and the numbers -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I keep all my stuff -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And she keeps all the events, doctors' visits.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, so you're able to look at that and you can always figure out.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just going to go, thinking about meeting my sister in law in Atlantic City on Thursday, okay, and she might do this, the doctor's appointment, or haircut or you make lists for things that I think are [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'll put the supermarket on it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Why put supermarket at all on this calander.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I'll put down I'm going to do laundry.  It's just.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> She's list oriented, I'm not.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But then it gives you the opportunity to look and see if you want.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I what?</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you wanted to, you could look at that list.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I could.  A lot of times she leaves lists on the kitchen table.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But she doesn't have that same agility.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> No, she thinks differently.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> To look and see what your plans are.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Mine are more or less in my.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Or I tell her, I will tell her though, but she, not written down, she doesn't remember or she's tunes it out I think sometimes.  I think your tunning me out.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Sometimes it changes too.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, sometimes yeah, but.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But I'll know when you go.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sometimes I have a couple of possibilities according to the weather.  I might go here if the weather is, yknow, permissible, if not, then I have an alternate plan.  I might go to the flea market and set up, but if I decide it's too cold then there's an auction, so maybe I'll take a ride to the auction.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> During the day, yknow, he comes and goes right now.  If he goes to an auction sometimes it's at night.  Well, I need to know that cause otherwise I'm not going to -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Dinner plans.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yknow, for dinner [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I understand, of course I'll tell her that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And that's the one that I get annoyed that I forget or I haven't been told.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You've been told, you've always been told.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Do you each carry cell phones?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes, we do.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> So if there's a question in the middle of the day that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Are you going tomorrow or are you going, yknow?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Even like, we're going back to Italy to our son's.  He had gotten a time share in Tuscany which now I realize that going to time share that we went to this time and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I loved it and she didn't, so we both went the same places and did the same things.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But I'm willing to go back to Italy and do the Tuscany area and whatnot, but I don't want to stay at the time share.  And it's 40 miles from Florence airport and it's like in the middle of nowhere.  I'm willing to go on a tour and that where we could see Florence and Tuscany and Venice and then go down to my son's. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah have it all planned.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We can even do it from there because they have the trips from the, uh, but I want to cancel, like I want to cancel the time share, and he's just so adamant about it, and I said, I can't, I cant relax enough to even think of going.  I'd rather stay home.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This is next October.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, we don't, because it has to be canceled in, by the end of February.  We don't have a lot of time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't really want to cancel it though and you do.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, and my theory is I'm not going.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'll think about canceling it if we have an alternate plan in place.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yknow what the tours are?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's what I mean, you have the whole tour set up.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I have a book that draws them out.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think, yknow, maybe that's the thing, just agreeing to sit down at some point, maybe this weekend or something, and just, yknow, looking over the books.  Maybe you'll find that there's a tour that looks really good.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, where my son is too they have, um, because he's at the naval base, they have USO tours and -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But they don't always, some are only one day.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, but.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And a lot of times they're not, uh, every day.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But they're long weekends and stuff.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe you'll find like one that's geared towards younger retirees.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] we have a couple of people that have told us about the.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Actually I think you heard about some Perillo's tours.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Perillo tours.  Perillo is with, uh, [INAUDIBLE] but right now were undecided.  We want to go on a, we don't know.  I've gotta see what's available.  I shouldn't say I don't know, because I really don't know what's available the time we want to go and I want to go to certain areas.  If it's included in the tour that's fine.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, you can do land and you can do land and plane.  And the plane is not good because.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'd rather fly over on my own, I'd rather fly on my own, say the tour stuff's on Tuesday and if we get there on Sunday, then we're on our own for a few days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Then it sounds like you.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just enjoying the tour.  That's fine.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> There's some things that you really want to do, then let's find a tour that matches -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Matches our time frame.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> The kind of stuff, and also meets what you guys want to do while you're there.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But we don't have definite dates, because we don't have any, we don't have to, he doesn't put in for a vacation or whatever.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  We [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But you have the time share already.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  That's mid end of October.  So those dates are kind of locked in.  But I could, we still could use a week.  We stay there for 5 days of the week.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, but the last time it didn't work.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure it worked, I loved it.  I love the time share.  She didn't because of the language barrier.  That's her main.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It wasn't only that.  There was these places, this one looks like to be in the middle no man's land.  It's just like, and it's not written up in any of the books.  There was no, uh, feedback on it.  You're not going to rent a car.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No.  It's just something that [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] not familiar with the area.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So I feel I would rather go on a tour and just see spend 2 days in Florence, yeah 2 days in Florence, they get the hotels, yknow you're staying in good places, and they take you and then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We might do that.  Yknow, I haven't said no.  I just don't know yet.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It sounds like you just need to sit down and like, yknow, come up with a compromise and that sounds like it's going to involve it being very well planned.  So it's looking at all your alternatives.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I like having it planned, so it's not a bad idea really.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Although, yknow, again, I think if you, yknow, coming up with a compromise may include planning either way. </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I don't want to.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It's a [INAUDIBLE] to do a compromise.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't rule out anything.  I'm open for either or, but she's so, see, she's -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No I'm not open for the time share.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See she's not open for either or.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, if you don't see a tour that looks any better, if the tours all look horrible.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> See, that's the problem.  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I can't, I cant, it was so bad last time.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was so good.  What was, I loved it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We have different reactions.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I loved it.  We went to the same places.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But when you're making a decision together.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I loved every minute of it.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> When you're making a decision together, you have to kind of compromise.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You enjoyed it while we were there, now when we get home, you're.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, no, no, I didn't enjoy being dragged around like we just, we had no clue where we were going.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Sure we did.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is that particular time share the only time share you have an option for?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> In Italy at this moment, yes.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And I don't, after staying at the previous time share.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I liked it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It was just out of the way and it was just I don't know, wasn't what we're used to here.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> If you don't do that particular time share, is there another alternative besides the tour?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, a tour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Besides the tour.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, we're going to be at my son's [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not really.  We'd be on our own at the places without [INAUDIBLE].  Say two days here or three days there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Is there a resort that's on a time share that's in [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> There are places, of course.  We'll have to look, we have to look.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But it becomes.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That'd be more costly too.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It's going to be a lot more costly, but.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But is it worth the cost?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  We haven't pursued it yet.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, we haven't pursued it.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We should.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> The other, the other thing is like I said, from my son's from Naples, the USO has these -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's too far away from the northern -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, no, but they do have these tours for a week that they do go to Tuscany and Venice and Florence.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That whole area in Tuscany around Florence has all kinds of tours that are from, yknow, that just look at [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I can go over to other places along the coast.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, you've been there.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, but I think there's a lot of tour companies that do specialty tours like cooking tours -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That just look at different restaurants at Tuscany to art tours to, yknow, the, there's more like outdoor kinds of tours, like hiking.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, and then I do have another book for 2008 from some other tour group.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We'll have to look into it more.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But, um, I would rather spend, see as much as I could in 2 days here, 2 days there, then spend a week and after 2 days be bored and there's nothing around and nothing.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I can understand that.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And stuff, but.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I thought we could possibly rent a car for a few days.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I won't get in a car, not in Italy.   </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why, it's just that they drive at this pace.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I was in a car and that was enough.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well my son drives.  My daughter-in-law drives and we're all over.  It's just that they drive at a fast pace.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Rome was unbelievable.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  [INAUDIBLE] try driving through New York City. </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, no, no, you can drive through New York City.  People stay in lanes, they don't go 12 lanes [INAUDIBLE] like that.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But if you're from, I don't know, somewhere in Missouri.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We'll probably go to Missouri.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> It can be worse -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> When we go to New York I only go to Manhattan.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] but knowing that people do it every day.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it's a different pace.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> May father did it for years from Jersey to Long Island.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And people do it every day in Rome.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so they get used to it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But I'm not in the car with them.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And a little gap and somebody's cutting you off.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We went to London and we went on a tour to Scotland.  It was wonderful because it was like 5 days or something.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Four day tour.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Four days.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's fine when they're 4 or 5 days.  I don't want to go on a 10 day tour.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And that is where people drive on the opposite side of the road.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] we got in a bus, we went on a tour.  And it was wonderful because we liked it because everybody's English [INAUDIBLE] and you can understand them, so all the highlights of what you have to see, especially on a first trip there.  You have no idea what you're looking for.  And I think that that's so important to see, I mean, when we went to Rome, the way we did Rome, my gosh, no one would talk anyone.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I'm sure there probably are some people that would pick a, yknow, a time share in Tuscany just to be in that particular region, that particular place.  Although it's not quite like a Aruba where you go and have, it's a resort where there's the beach and this and that.  You probably have to travel a little bit.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You have to either get on a 1 day tour here or there, or a car.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have to kind of prioritize.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Which I was thinking about a car for a few days.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> But the, but the car is just as costly as a tour.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> For the whole time, but for a few days.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> My guess is if you look at some tours you probably could get more sights into a briefer period of time and be able to enjoy them without having to [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm not against it.  I just, as far as I'm concerned I like the, to look at all the alternates.  She doesn't.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I could imagine if you were in Tuscany and you were the one planning that you would be waking up 15 minutes, 20 minutes before you'd have to get going.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> To make sure I don't miss.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  Versus like letting the tour bus driver, yknow, make sure everyone is kind of following.  Yknow what I'm saying?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take the pressure off, let them be the tour guide.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You're right.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Especially if you were planning on seeing so much.  I think it would be good.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> A tour would be easier on her.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> It would be much easier. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You wouldn't have to be the one doing the planning.  You wouldn't have to be, yknow, revved up to kind of make sure it happens.  The tour would be responsible for that.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You have to make sure you make [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, even when we were in, uh -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> No, we didn't have a problem.  We were going to Sorrento and then on to [INAUDIBLE], so we were doing public transportation.  And so my son left us at the train station, get the train to Sorrento, and then we had to find a bus.  Now we get off the train and I said, well, let's ask.  Well, he won't ask anybody.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Most people don't understand you.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Well, that's the other problem.  So we got, he says just go this way and he had me up a hill, well it was nothing.  I said where is there a bus.  We went down, we finally found a bus.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Right across from the train station.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Had we walked out the other door of the train we would have been at the bus.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> At the bus, yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Well, we found it.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So but he.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> But we got the tour of [INAUDIBLE] Sorrento.  We would have normally not seen.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> He found a flea market.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I'm adventurous.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well you have a story to tell when you came home.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> That's the kind of thing like that's our tours when we [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You just didn't like dragging your luggage uphill.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Are you okay with medications?</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, we have a minor problem with it, so, uh -</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, I talked to your office and I'm not sure.  I still haven't gotten the latest prescri -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Not sure if it's, I know that you forwarded us some type of a prescription and it should have been forwarded to my [INAUDIBLE] instead, and I don't know what's happening.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> But we reduced the Prozac from 40 -</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> That's the problem.  The 40 was, uh, to 30 but in order to have 30, they don't have a 30, so it's [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> They were, uh, what were they doing?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> What they were doing, they sent us one month of 20, 10 and 10.  A month's supply of 20, a month's supply of 10 to equal the 30.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Which is how you had written it.  But what happened was because we're mail we have -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You need 90.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> We need 90.  And it was, yeah, it was like.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Triple the deductible.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, okay.  Instead of 30 dollars for 3 months, we paid a 120 dollars for 1 month.  But so what I did was I talked to them and they told me exactly how they have it written, which is I called your office.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Then you sent me a copy, not knowing that we hadn't picked up the mail.  I talked to them again and they were going to send another thing on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I have, I see the form here.  And I got that last week, although I wanted to see you today because I was thinking that if you had done okay with going from 40 to 30.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, I understand.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> That what we might want to do is go from 30 to 20 and just keep it at twenty for a period of time.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Okay, well, I ordered, I ordered the -</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> First one, okay.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> I sent in the first one that you sent me from the 30 which is 270.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] on the 30 [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Before we went away you wrote me and instead of sending it to Medco it came to me.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> On [DATE], uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right, okay.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> It was [DATE]</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> And then we were, so I got it in the mail not knowing that that's why I called the beginning of the week.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We haven't used that prescription.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> You have not mailed it in yet.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes, I did.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, you did?</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes, I mailed it in the same day I got it.  I mailed it in Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> This week?  </p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yes.  So I mailed it in.  But it is all 10s.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Right, the 3.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Three 10s, 30.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So it could actually be used as 20 if that's what you want him to do.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I have 20 and 10, I could still go to 20.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> You decide.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Take 2 tens instead of 3.  Yeah, let's cut it back to 20</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Twenty.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And then if you need to then at least you'll have the resource to go back up to 3.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> I don't think you're going to need it.  I think you'll be fine taking 20.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And I think that's more of a standard Prozac dose too at this point.  I think that's a good maintenance dose for you.  So, um, why don't you go ahead and cut it back, so you don't need a prescription today because you're going to get all those.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Right.  As long as they, as long as they fill the one I sent in.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> If there's any problem we'll have to call your office.  </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> So we'll know within a week or so.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> And if we need to, then I think, see, they make the 40s and they make the 20s and they make the 10, they don't make a 30.  So I think partly what the insurance probably was doing probably.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> Yeah, and we forgot to tell you that it's a 90 day mail and stuff. </p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>CG:</b> So, yknow, we made ourselves.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it sounds like you should be okay then.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> I think we'll be all right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.  Good.  Good.  </p>
<p><b>PT:</b> We'll be all right.</p>
<p><b>DR:</b> Well, then let's get you set up for another visit.</p>
<p><b>PT:</b> And I will see you again -</p>

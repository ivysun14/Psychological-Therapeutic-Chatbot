<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good morning. [Things aren't progressing too good in the last day, but I'm better.] (inaudible at 00:00:08) I haven't slept more than three hours in the last two nights, which is not good. (chuckles) Between sleep medications it was like uggh. Yeah. The sleeping and the eating are not going well, but I got up an hour early today because I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep. I started writing a letter to Jerry and Ashley for their birthday, which is coming up. It was a little schmaltzy. (laughs) Just a whole lot of really good people—thinking about them in particular. I did a lot of thinking back last night about a year like, "What happened in your year?" and I realized it's not exactly accurate to say that I didn't have any friends until I was 14. I've always kind of thought or remembered being depressed before my parents split up but if I look at the actual memories I have of class, it really didn't start until that year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were six? [00:01:44]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was seven, so second grade. I remember having friends and in retrospect having normal friendships in kindergarten and first grade. In second grade we went to Africa for six weeks or so. My dad took a sabbatical. When I came back my best friend had become best friends with somebody else. It was so hard. I just remember that being so hard. I kind of lost touch with everybody in the class.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You went during the school year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. And those two girls actually stayed best friends—I think they're still best friends, so that's okay. I mean, I forgive them. (laughs) It was, for the rest of my time, there were these two girls that I really liked and they were just so tight and there was no room for anybody else. Yeah, that was really hard. [00:02:59] I don't remember whether my parents split up during the school year or during the summer. It might have been over the summer, but everything was "off" after that. I never could connect and then in third grade I found books and so I had to try less hard because I had books. That was it. I was never loved by anybody other than my family until I hit St. Margaret's. I was writing to Jerry and Ashley about this. We were on a choir trip to Scotland when we were 14. We had been in choir together so we were friends, but it was suddenly very intense spending all day together. We were the only freshmen on the trip. We were all we had. [00:03:59] And they've kind of said in retrospect they felt like they were kind of mean to me on that trip. What I remember is just like feeling so loved, so loved, feeling so loved for the things that other people didn't like me for—like they were really into books. That was awesome. They were really into Cadbury Cream Eggs and cathedrals and history, and ridiculous things. And we did fight, but what I remember is being too much, too intense, joking too much, not knowing when to stop, and they would get angry with me and leave; and I would be like, "Okay, well I guess that's it. No more friends for me." Like no friends ever. And then they would come back. That never happened. Yeah. That was pretty awesome. Yeah. (pause) [00:05:21] Their mom is the one who called me the third twin. It feels really good, even though Kate has about as many issues as my mom. (laughs) Different issues, but . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But a lot. [00:05:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A lot. (laughs) Maybe not as many, but I think both Jerry and Ashley have spent the last ten years or so trying to figure out how to get right with themselves. She made Ashley keep a weight journal when she was ten and she didn't make Jerry, because Ashley was always the fat twin—always. (sighs) [00:06:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:23) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (laughs) The day before my wedding she told me—I was staying with them before the wedding—they were the only people in my family that lived close to where we were getting married and the day before the wedding she told me I was doing everything wrong with the food and I needed to hire somebody to serve the food. I was like, "Did you not see me crying every day for the past week?" (laughs) "Did you not catch the part where I'm barely holding it together?" That was too bad in the sense that Amanda, who is quite protective of me as you may have gathered, I don't think screaming was actually involved, but she gave it to Kate in pretty clear terms. They did not make up. They live in the same city and both work for the church. They don't go to the same church, but they see each other at least twice a week. They're not cold and they've agreed to pretend didn't happen, but I don't think either of them has really forgiven the other. Maybe Kate has forgiven Amanda—probably so, actually, but Amanda has not forgiven Kate. She doesn't see why I love her. [00:08:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Amanda doesn't see why you love Kate?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's been hard over the years. She really wanted to be my mom which is really wonderful, but also I didn't want her to be my mom. (laughs) I did, but Kate doesn't really do boundaries. (chuckles) She has lots of really good ideas for how other people should run their lives, but sometimes they're not the greatest ideas and she's just never going to get the concept that sometimes people have to figure things out on their own. There have been times that I've needed to step back and just say, "No, I'm going to do things my way." And then just take a break for a week or a month, just like not seeing her much. I get really angry and I don't know how to deal with that. [00:09:32] And also because she's never going to apologize. She's never going to see that . . . I drove up to visit them one year and I was driving my dad's car which might have sort of been my car at the time, but I don't remember; you know, there's been a shuffle. The way we do cars in my family is that we buy them at about 100,000 miles and we drive them until they die because my dad is pretty good with cars and he really likes having a project to work on. That's the real reason. (laughs) He's been working on the same outboard motors for 25 years. (laughs) [00:10:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like for the boats?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. There's an amazing picture that they took one year in Canada when we went with my grandparents. We were in a fishing camp because they were too old to really camp. We spent the entire week without going out on the water because my grandfather was sitting on the dock trying to put a 50-year-old motor back together, trying to make it run. There is this fantastic picture of my grandfather and my father sitting together with this motor and parts everywhere between them, like that's exactly right. That's exactly right. [00:10:56] Kate is never going to apologize; occasionally she will. If she sees that she's upset you she will apologize because you're upset, but she doesn't understand what it is that was wrong. Her kids have never been able to get her to see this. So I drove the car up and there was something wrong with something. It broke down while I was there and I had to call AAA and get it figured out and call my dad and mess. It happens once every six months to a year with our cars. They don't usually break down en route these days, but I think that's just because we travel less. [00:11:52] She just said, "You guys shouldn't buy old cars. You need to be buying newer cars. It's stupid to buy an old car. You should buy a new car and then you have other people take care of it for you." I was just like, "No." (laughs) "We do things the way we want to. I do things the way I want to. This is not in your jurisdiction," and it wasn't just that she expressed an opinion, it was, "You must do it this way and I'm going to ensure that you do." Like "I'm going to help you do things the right way." (sighs) So I was like . . . (laughs) [00:12:41]</p>

<p>Like she told me I should break up with Bryan before we went to college which, in retrospect, probably would have been the right decision, but the 18-year-old is never going to do that. She is never going to break up with a boyfriend. It's just not going to happen. And she pushed and pushed and pushed and finally I just left for a while. But she thinks of me as her daughter, which is hard but really lovely. Yeah. So that's what I was thinking about this. (pause) I've been thinking about James a lot. We talked about it yesterday also. (pause) I haven't gotten very far with it, thinking about it. [00:14:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't have the impression that you had anybody around who was helping you put together what a lot of these experiences meant and felt like for you. Pretty much every single memory you've mentioned has at least a very sad aspect to it. You've mentioned a bunch of them, half a dozen or ten, and all of them do. [00:15:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Last night—kind of going back about a year—that was the first time I remembered something that didn't have a sad aspect to it. I remembered when I was in first grade I had a best friend, his name was Tommy, we played on the playground. We played pirate ship every single day. That was awesome. That was just awesome. That's it. I guess I also figured out how to calculate 100 faster than counting in hundredth day in kindergarten. I was the only person who figured it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Some schools do this where the hundredth day of school the teacher would sort of be like, "I'm a hundred years old," and we totally believed her. (laughs) Of course. [00:16:22] And so she was like, "We have a cake for hundred day and we need to cut it into 100 pieces. How can we do that?" I was the person who figured out ten by ten and nobody got that; and that felt so good. It was like, "Yes. I'm a rock star." (both laugh) But, yeah. That's about it. Sorry. I think you said you didn't feel like anybody [- like processing happened—that thoughtful leap. (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Helping you put together what happened and how it made you feel in a way that gave you any perspective about what was happening. The "other people" feature of all of this is that everybody else is disconnected. Jerry and Ashley had a different perspective and memory about what happened. Your dad and your grandfather were really getting into putting these engines together and nobody could go in the water because of it all weekend. [00:17:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) We eventually got in the water. The other clear memory I have from that weekend is my grandmother sitting on the dock, white-hot furious saying, "I have stock in Coca Cola. I will buy him a new God-damned boat." (laughs) Like "I want to go on a boat ride." That's not the way I put it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not the way you put it, and that's entirely about what she wanted or Kate loves you, which is great and thinks of you as her daughter, which in some ways is great and in some ways is precisely indicative of the sort of "boundarylessness" she has about everything, which is your problem. Nothing is reconciled or put together. I don't mean nothing is ever reconciled from your life or put together, but the way you're describing it, the different points of view that people had and the feelings, even as you talk about it about what went on, are all separate pieces. [00:19:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, that face was an "oh, they're supposed to be reconciled?" face—like literally. (chuckles) Yeah. I try to do it myself, but clearly I'm not getting it so far. Yeah. I tell you, I have so much therapy. I saw a therapist from when I was seven until I was 14 once a week. Then I saw people kind of on-and-off in high school, particularly in my senior year when I was really depressed, and not really in college; then I saw somebody at college. I saw somebody at the university. I've been in a lot of professional care and I've not really gotten anywhere. They put me on Paxil when I was in sixth grade, I remember. It's been unclear, but I remember now. I'm trying to figure out what happened, which came out of a thought experiment saying, "What would happen if I just looked at the last two years and said, 'Yes, yes this happened.'" And then kind of saying, "What would happen if I looked at the year before and said, 'Yes,'" all the way down. It was good. [00:21:24] </p>

<p>They put me on Paxil when I was in sixth grade, and then they switched me to Prozac for reasons that are unclear and I stayed on it until I was heading off to high school. I went off it and then went back on in high school; went off of it in college. I don't know why everyone was so disconnected. I know part of it was that I tried very, very hard to keep people from knowing what was happening to me. I was completely terrified that my therapist would find out that I was depressed—white-knuckle terrified every week. White-knuckle is an exaggeration. I liked her a lot. We'd play games a lot and stuff. I don't know whether I knew that the things that I was upset about were the things I was supposed to talk to her about or whether I knew it on some level but just was kind of that if I told her about it that the world would end. I think it was the latter. [00:23:06] Somebody must have seen that something was going on because I didn't ask to keep seeing her between seven and eleven, which is when I first said, "I was playing basketball today and nobody passed to me once and that was really awful." That was the first thing that I said. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that was the first thing you said to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The first thing I said that was a "things are bad," that was me deliberately me trying to let her know that things were bad. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or to let her in on how bad things were.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was trying to avoid that phrasing because I feel like it's clichéd. (laughs) A splinter of ice. Did I say that before saying about the writer having a splinter of ice in the heart? I don't remember if it was P.D. James or P.D. James quoting somebody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You mean like a [ ] (inaudible at 00:24:44) like cliché?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no. Like even when it means exactly the right thing or it's true, it feels like a cliché; and so I want to avoid that phrasing because I'm focused on—I want the words to be beautiful and that's more important on some level than whatever is happening. In my mind it's the same thing as, I think I told you, something [Neal Greenman] (ph) wrote being about a car accident and getting out of the car and seeing blood and glass on the sidewalk and police milling around and all of these cars and being both completely horrified and in one level of his mind saying, "How am I going to write this?" Yeah. That's the only thing that makes me think that I could be a writer—that I think like that—because I don't actually write. (laughs) But that was the first time. (pause) [00:26:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think you still often feel—including in here—like the world is going to end if these things come together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What I thought had been my motivation in not talking very much about my childhood, is something more along the lines of, "God, what a cliché." Some combination of that and of saying, "I don't want that to be me." Like that's not who I am anymore. I am who I am here now, and that's what . . . </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yet that sounds a lot like your childhood.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I know. Yes. I am realizing that. (laughs) A little shamefacedly, but I'm trying to be okay with it. (laughs) (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That must have been scary.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's how I do everything. [ ] (inaudible at 00:27:53) But yeah, probably. I don't see the direct connection right now but I thought it, if that makes sense. I guess if I talk about it I have to say that is still me in some sense, yeah, and that is very scary. I'm so proud of who I am now. Not for the last couple of years, but I have been so proud. I made friends. I have them often in my life. I have people who believe in me. I had a career. (sniggers) I got into this university. I had those things. I have been so proud of that (sniffles) and I feel like I'm clutching them to myself and I don't want to talk about before I had those things; which isn't to say that I don't actually want to. I need to. The image that kept coming up last night when I was doing this was that there is so much space hollowed out of me, so much suffering, so much. (sniffles) And there is just like all of these hollow spaces still. I don't know what's going to happen there. [00:30:40] (sniffles) </p>

<p>The story I told James last night about my childhood, which is also a horrible story (laughs), we were talking about—I couldn't eat dinner because I was hungry but I didn't like it that much and something about the Adderall, I'm pretty sure it was the Adderall because I don't usually do this. I just couldn't eat it. I felt like I was going to throw up. We were talking about that sensation and I was telling him when I was about nine my mom was living at my grandparents' house, her parents' house, which was fun for everybody. [00:31:35] My grandmother brought a big box of cinnamon buns home from Costco or something and I was really excited because I really like cinnamon buns. We each had one and we sat down around the table and they were disgusting, like disgusting. Not "I don't want to eat this" as a child because I'm stubborn, but I cannot get it past my throat. I think I will throw up if I eat this. I couldn't say, "I don't like it." I don't remember whether I tried to say it and somebody said, "Eat it," or whether I just knew that I couldn't say, "I don't like it." I would pick little pieces off of it and stuff them in pockets to try and act like I was eating it slowly when nobody was watching. I was very sneaky. It was a big-ass cinnamon bun and it was clear that I had very full pockets. I was not fooling anybody, but I thought I was. [00:32:45] So afterwards I got up from the table and I went outside to empty them out and I turned around and my grandfather was standing on the porch. He looked at me straight-faced, just like this, and said, "I saw what you did," and he turned around and he just walked back inside and [ ]. (inaudible at 00:33:07) That is an emotion that is written on my memory that I have of my grandfather. I don't remember anything else about him. I'm sure I remember some things, but that is the only thing I remember clearly. James was like, "What the fuck?" I was like, "I know. What the fuck?" He was like, "Did he have food issues from the depression?" The best I can think about it he was a prisoner of war in the Korean war or possibly World War II. I don't remember. Food was weird at their house, like you had to eat everything, and usually it wasn't very good. [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:57) Did I tell you that story already?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It took me ten years for it to occur to me that that was about him and not about me, or that that was not as an adult how I would behave towards a nine-year-old. I don't feel guilt about it anymore, but I felt guilt for ten years. [00:34:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's it like to be a nine-year-old who did that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: In that moment it was like I always did everything wrong and the best I could hope for was that people wouldn't notice. Now I'm just realizing that people would always notice and they would always call me on it and I would always be wrong. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You felt so ashamed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So ashamed. How dare I be ungrateful for this treat because any desserts were kind of a treat in their house? My grandmother had been excited, pleased with herself. How dare I? What is wrong with me that I can't just eat it, that I can't like it, that I can't act like I like it? Or that when I try to act like I like it, that it's not good enough. [00:36:27] If I had to sum up my childhood I would say I hid, that everything I did was oriented towards hiding and I could never hide well enough. (pause) That's what it was. (pause) [00:37:37] Because I'm sure that even as an adult I'm 80 percent sure if I had said that I don't like this, they would have made me eat it and watched to make sure that I did. I think those actually were my choices. Why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was just thinking like, "I think I'm going to run with this one." (both laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I respect that. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's a real struggle in your present life as well, to which you hide how you don't take in what people have to offer and feel really bad about it. [00:39:12]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Can you keep going?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me put it another way. I think the story just described much more directly what I was sort of vaguely pointing at before about the memories from your childhood seeming in pieces, like people not coming together with the emotions that were there in the stories, not being part of the stories as you told them. It's like you sort of, instead of digesting yourself what you were talking about, what happened to you really—like instead of you being able to digest what happened, you are kind of tearing it into pieces and putting it somewhere else, you know? [00:40:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) That is exactly what I'm doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought that was just what people do. I don't know how else I would deal with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you try so hard to do it otherwise. You try to put things together. You try to connect with people and often with success. I'm not saying you can't do that or you don't do that or that's not one of the most valuable things in your life when you do that. But whether it's you and James disagreeing about something and his trying to comfort you and your being wracked because the way he's trying to comfort you is not helping and if you take in what he says, it's actually quite hurtful because it's very different than the way from where you're coming from. Yet you feel terrible about it because you know he's really trying and doing what he can do. You sort of work very hard with him to reconcile—and with success—I'm not saying without. [00:41:43]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not doubting trying to figure it out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Like, "No, don't tell me why it doesn't make sense that I'm upset. Talk to me about how I'm upset." The cinnamon bun is he's there trying to help, trying to say things to make you feel better, but when it's of the form . . . [00:42:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't say, "I don't want to eat this. Can we have something else?" I say, "Thank you," and then I shove it in my pockets.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When he does it in the way where it's like he tells you logically why it doesn't make sense to be upset or gives you the algorithm for what you need to do to improve things or make things better or tackle something—and sometimes it's not bad advice. He's trying, he's very well intended and so forth. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This all works for him. [00:43:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But it's not what tastes good for you at that moment. Then I think you feel so guilty and so ashamed that you can't make use of the help or it's not the help you want, or it makes you feel worse in some way when things don't go—this is one scenario.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know. I know, but yeah. James is less of a good example than most people, but yes, you're right. I said he's less of a good example because that happens less often with him than with other people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's probably in part because of the work you two have put in to sorting it out. Anyway, there's a lot more to say about it, but we'll stop there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I think you're right. I can't decide whether that's a funny or a horrible analogy, but it's a good one certainly. (chuckles) Yeah. (pause) [00:44:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, the main thing is that the memory is a horrible one [ ]. (inaudible at 00:44:47) </p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess the funny comes from "it should be a funny thing." I mean, you know. The story that brought that story up was James talking about how his mom was going to put her foot down and said, "You're not leaving the table until those lima beans are gone," when he was four, and his baby sister was toddling around. This was several hours later. They're all stubborn. Baby sister is toddling around. She likes lima beans. She scoops them up and eats them. Mom says, "That's good enough." (laughs) The things kids do to get out of eating things they don't like are funny. [00:45:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sometimes. Or they should be. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, they should be. If your grandfather had said something funny or kind . . . </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or even, "Let's get something else." Anything. It would have been good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We need to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a good day.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thanks. You, too.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Things?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I'm actually doing a lot better now, that light is working wonders.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that working?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's working really good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much time are you using?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I started out with 15 minutes, twice a day, and now lately I've been doing 30 minutes and then 15 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, so 30 in the morning and 15 in the evening?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What else do you want to know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Has it affected your sleep?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, nope.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what have you noticed in terms of differences there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, just feeling a lot better, more energy, uh, less depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, how about as far as, um, you know, that camera issue?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All that's been gone for a while now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's gone?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's gone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When did that clear up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, that cleared up probably about a month ago.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, and feeling suspicious of people?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah lately I've been getting kind of paranoid.  One night I stayed up all night drinking Monsters and energy drinks with my cousin [NAME OTHER] and I started to think that people could read my thoughts.  But then I went to sleep at like 10:00 in the morning and I woke up and it was pretty much gone and I started feeling a lot better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, caffeine can do that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, especially staying up all night, that's probably -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not helpful for those kinds of thoughts, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But that's better since that one night?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, that's been a lot better.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how about the alcohol use?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, actually, after our meeting I quit for 2 weeks, but the last, like, not last meeting, maybe it was one of our meetings, I don't remember which one, but I quit for 2 weeks there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I saw you on the [DATE] -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of December.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think it was about then.  I quite for 2 weeks, but then what, the last week and a half or 2 weeks, I've been drinking more.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Did you get in to see the chemical dependency counselor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, my mom made an appointment for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Again, it's really important to absolutely stop using alcohol.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I mean -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm kind of trying but it's kind of tough to stop.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that does concern me because that says to me that you're ability to stop on your own, that that's really tough for you to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And I think we need to get you some additional support.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you know when that appointment is?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, we can ask my mom if you want to go get her pretty soon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me just check here and see if we have an appointment set up.  Or, do you know where she set that up at?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no I don't know much about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then you said you've increase the use again.  How much are you drinking currently?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, only about 6 beers at a time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And how many days out of the week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably about 3 or 4, maybe even, yeah, 3 or 4.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And other issues with the medication that you're seeing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, but that one anxiety medicine, I quit taking that for a long time, and I just, I just started taking it about 2 weeks ago, and it seems to help a real lot with my paranoia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, except that one you can't really take -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When you're drinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It does do a great job in helping with the anxiety that can make people feel more anxious.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We do know caffeine makes your paranoia worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Staying up at night makes it worse.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That Klonopin can help with the anxiety, but with the alcohol in your system, you just can't be taking it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah because when I'm not taking my anxiety medicine I start to feel more anxiety.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which can potentially give me paranoia.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So I like that anxiety medicine.  I was wondering if I can get a few more, uh, prescriptions for it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, again, that depends on the alcohol use.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> If you're able to -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh yeah, well, I'm not drinking that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, you will be really back to that 12 beers fairly soon -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Two weeks nothing and now you're 6.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three to 4 days per week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll get right back up there again.  So, let me have you mom come in so we can find out -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The appointment there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> See, I don't see it at [DEIDENTIFIED], or within our [DEIDENTIFIED] so I'm just wondering if she set it up somewhere else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She told me she did, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, wait here.  Um, okay, well a couple things.  Good side, it sounds like the light has helped him with energy and the mood quite a bit, so I think that was a good move -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To get that going, and the time that he's using it seem to be pretty appropriate.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> He could use it 3 times a day, [INAUDIBLE] or anything, would that hurt anything?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, really twice a day is all that people need.  It's the total time per day that tends to work best, and we usually try to front end load it because of if you use too much at nighttime, it can affect people's sleep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, I see [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you, I kind of look at 2 to 1 if people need it twice a day.  Twice as much in the morning than in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and really probably after 7:00, we don't want people to use it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't use it after 7:00 very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um, so that, that seems to work pretty well.  He did go a couple weeks without drinking and that is obviously very good, but he's gone back to using some alcohol again, so I was wondering, what, has there been an appointment set up that you're aware of?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Not yet.  Um, we call, I called last week and they apparently didn't know what I was talking about because I asked for a dual diagnosis and not just a diagnosis as the, for alcoholism, but it's got, we need somebody who, you know, familiar with his mental illness, that's what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Now, was that here?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> No -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> You told me to me call [DEIDENTIFIED], so then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I tried [DEIDENTIFIED] and I said that to them and they knew nothing about what I was talking about.  So now what I need to do is I need to call up insurance and see what they cover, if they have a special program with the county, because he's on the county insurance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay which county, it is [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Okay.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And I'm not sure, do you know how they run, I, I don't know, really.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't' know who they have affiliation with.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, but if you called [DEIDENTIFIED] again and said I need a chemical -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, we're going to call your guys', or your nurse or somebody -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I was just looking here, we don't have any notes related to that.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, the appointment he needs is a chemical dependency evaluation.  All they -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> One thing she said is, "You can do that."  Because that's what I said, I said, "Well, to get a, a, some kind of a test for chemical dependency."  And then they had said, "Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] can do that."  And then, so then I was really confused.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, yeah.  I don't, I don't know, was it like an intake person, or do you know?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I just talked to the receptionist and they transferred me to a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  So let's help define what we need here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He needs a chemical dependency assessment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, why does he have to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and not here?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because we don't have any chemical dependency counselors here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Otherwise we would be doing it here.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well, why didn't she know that when I was talking about?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, I'm not sure.  They don't have access to our notes, so they don't, so it's a chemical dependency counseling, or chemical dependency counselor evaluation.  The dual diagnosis thing may have thrown this person off, um, but the person at [DEIDENTIFIED], and they have 2 or 3 chemical dependency counselors and they're all very familiar with mental health issues.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Including, you know, schizophrenia, depression, and all these conditions they're familiar with.  But what we're looking for is a program specifically for [PATIENT NAME] to help deal with the substance abuse issue.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay?  The dual diagnosis -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> So don't even mention dual diagnosis?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's, I mean because the receptionist there isn't trained to know -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All these different conditions.  What we're specifically wanting to get is a chemical dependency evaluation.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Dependency evaluation.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] back to you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and I, what I can do is suggest, we are dealing with a chemical dependency issue.  What I'm asking of you -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> It probably was easier for that to happen that way, I think, because for some reason they were really confused when I called and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And said the dual diagnosis?</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, because you're the first person I've ever had have difficulty getting that evaluation.  They're usually -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Probably shouldn't have said dual diagnosis.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's something, that's something that -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's what you guys kept telling me, so I assumed that's what it  was.  That's why I told them they couldn't do it here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and we just don't have it here.  We don't have the chemical dependency -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Assessment piece here.  Now, what he'll do is assess for the alcohol.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and then give a recommendation for the most appropriate treatment options available for [PATIENT NAME], which could be inpatient, could be outpatient, um, could be an individual, um, treatment.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Well he'll have some say in what happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Absolutely, yeah, yep.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So I'll, but what they'll do is -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> If we get this evaluation will his, um, I guess what he, he would like to still happen, I just don't know if he and we was going to get into a point where, you know, it wouldn't matter, no matter [PATIENT NAME] wanted to do, he wouldn't allow it to do, it would happen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, and they'll, they'll give recommendations for treatment, then what you'll have to decide is what do you want to do with this recommendation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, in, all that information -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> I'm hoping that they have a driver too because [PATIENT NAME]'s already saying he doesn't want inpatient, and as far as outpatient, you know, we can't keep driving him everyday, or every, you know, or anything like that.  If it was once a week it might be doable, but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there are -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> There are, they have outpatient programs that are 5 days a week -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Three days a week, once a week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, nice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then there's always AA and those types of things that are available.  But what I want to get is, is a good assessment on the alcohol piece, and then the recommendations on where it would be best to get this taken care of because it's going to really complicate, it is, it's already complicated our treatment and it will further complicate it if we don't address this.  And this is not an uncommon condition, people dealing with any mental health diagnosis, there's a high risk of chemical dependency for people with schizophrenia, it's even higher still.  So it's not like, oh God, he's never seen this before, you know, they've seen this before.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> That's funny that that, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was, um, a little concerned that he wouldn't get, he would get the right kind of treatment, so I didn't think I didn't know how common this was.  But that's what he was more concerned about, [PATIENT NAME] getting the right treatment, and not being treated for, you know, chemical dependency as well as taking into consideration his mental health issues.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah and there are dual diagnosis programs -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] going down the wrong path.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and that dual diagnosis condition is usually more reserved for inpatient treatment.  Um, there are, there's one at [DEIDENTIFIED] that's kind of a dual diagnosis inpatient and an outpatient -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But most people with chemical dependency issues have mental health conditions as well, so it's very common to have a dual diagnosis.  But the program specifically is to help maintain sobriety.  The mental health piece, we're taking care of here, and alcohol is part of the mental health piece but in terms of the counseling and the medications for the schizophrenia, that's being taken care of here.  Now we've got to tackle the chemical, um, ordeal, alcohol abuse.  Okay?  So, right now, in terms of medication, we're going to stay the same.  We'll keep, we did talk about this Klonopin that he was on before which helps anxiety, but I can't prescribe that with the alcohol being an active issue because of the interaction problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, the key is maintain sobriety and then we can get you back on something that works well for anxiety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Those 2 things together can make people very intoxicated and, um, you know, if we give our worse case example is, uh, Heath Ledger, who was on a number of psychotropic medications and added alcohol in there and he died from an accidental overdose, so we just, I'm not comfortable prescribing that medication because with the alcohol used at the level -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> People can go into cardiopulmonary arrest so, okay?  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're task is sobriety, which you know, you made 2 weeks, and that's great.  I mean, I'm pretty proud of you going that far.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you went, you know, you slip back with it and you just got to come back in maintain sobriety.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, and I think you're okay on your refills, but let me check here.  Yep, you're good.  And, you're seeing [NAME OTHER] pretty regularly, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All righty, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're going to get you the number to the chemical dependency evaluation once again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Call up there and get that set up, and I should see you back in 6 weeks again.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well see how things are going.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> And has he, I think he already has an appointment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh, not with me, so -</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Oh, oh okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, so if he can get one coordinated on the same day you see [NAME OTHER] that's fine.</p>

<p><b>CG:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right, thanks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Drive safe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> We will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Bye bye.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How are you doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Pretty tired.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's pretty hot out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. I guess we're buying this building, so Karen is meeting with the owner and her advisor, I guess, right now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That place in Montclare, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So that'll be a new adventure (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It sounds exciting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it should be exciting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you been renting up to now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. We own a place, but it's sort of like a co-op and it's...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's right. The co-op.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I remember we talked about that a while ago.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There were problems there. So, yeah. I think it'll be good. It's going to take a lot of work and money. It was a little crazy. Actually, we probably waited too long. We ended up paying more money than... We got into a bidding war. If we had the opportunity to close it out earlier at a lower price, but then it became... It's a very bizarre situation to be in, because you have no idea what is real and what is not. So I knew a broker, who was maybe telling me the truth, maybe not. You have no way to gage it. No way to tell. You kind of have to do go with your instincts. It's a bit of a trial.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was like this big sigh right there. What are you experiencing right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, actually I'm experiencing more of the momentum of coming over and walking. I came another way than I did before, which actually was a way that made more sense, except I got off the wrong step on the PATH, never having taken it before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I got off at 14th Street instead of 18th Street, and then I decided it would be even better to walk over than take a train from there. I would rather walk anyway, except it's very hot. (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So now you arrive here and you're just worn out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Kind of. I haven't gotten a lot of sleep the last couple of nights, because of all of the stuff that's been going on. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're hot, you're tired, you're burned out, and now you've got to do this therapy thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, it's not, you know... I was actually looking forward to being in here and having it be a nice, cool room. (chuckles) I'm sort of sitting back. It gave me something to look forward to on my walk over.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The air-conditioning part?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. Anyway, I do feel like there's a lot going on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a little overwhelming, it sounds like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's a lot. It's a lot.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: New job, new house... All this stuff is happening.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'm nervous about it. I'm nervous about how it's all going to work out financially and everything, and how much it's really going to cost to build the place, to renovate it and how things are going to work out with the tenants who are there. It's a big responsibility. The place we have now is all paid off. It's not like it's that big of a deal. It's also a big mutual kind of thing. Karen and me are taking it on together. The last few months we've, well more than that, we've been having discussions about our relationship and the state of our relationship. So I worry about that. (5:15)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you commented on that last time. </p>

<p>PATIENT: It's sort of like it's odd. Why are we doing this? But it's sort of... I guess, in a way it's become an article of faith that is being resolved.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't be going into this together if your relationship was just about to fall apart.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) Right. Hopefully not. Hopefully not. I mean, we have discussed it, somewhat. And I guess Karen has been feeling better about the relationship. I just wonder how long... I've been... It's a little difficult now. Of course, I took that week off and that helped a lot. I took a week off... Of course, now I'm back to long hours now that I have a new job. I have to put my hours in and I guess, pay my dues. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As you say that, and maybe this is a little bit of a stretch, but I sort of felt part of what you described as the struggle with the relationship between you and Karen is sort of, how much time are you spending together being close and how much are you sort of doing your own thing and she's doing her own thing? It's sort of similar to what we were talking about last time, too. How we've been together... Part of you wanting me to be more active and push you harder and try to get things out of you... But part of you also liking the "hands off" approach.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) ... stand back a little bit, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... and letting you do your own thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just never expect... That's, of course, the kind of thing that I have a lot of expertise in - straddling the fence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of like getting close and then pulling back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Not knowing what's better, really. Not being able to define what is better. I mean, really, I don't think that's a straight answer, really. Sometimes I need a little push. Sometimes I don't. But... (8:18)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, have you thought more about... Last time we sort of talked about where are we in our work together? What are we going to do from here? We sort of have come to a point. We've learned certain things and have come so far, but now it feels to both of us like we're turning a corner in some way. We're at a fork in the road, or something like that. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I feel like it is somewhat of a fork. I don't know how big of a fork it is.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, can you sort of say how it is you think about it? What are you ideas about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I think change is an incremental thing. I think that I have made incremental changes and sometimes I've made them... In some cases, it turns out.. I think I've been surprised that just a small change can actually generate a larger one, in a sense or can open things up more...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... than you might have thought ahead of a time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... than I might have thought. It's like an ounce of prevention or something like that (chuckles) along those lines. But I also feel that to some extent it also has to do with my situation not being... There's not as much, perhaps, there to feel conflicted about at the moment, although there is a lot going on. It's sort of still developing. Like things at work. My position at work and the whole corporate/political thing which there's a minimal amount of probably anyway... I see potential for conflicts coming down the road, there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But now it just feels really new. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Now it feels pretty new, and I'm settling in. People are generally happy that I'm there. I got a lot of billing beforehand, so...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like it feels pretty good so far.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. It does. I can see that there might be some problems I'll have with certain people, but I think I already see that coming and I'm preparing for it in some ways. There are still other issues. There are things I've put out of the way with our buying the building. It's going to... What's the word.. Bring back from the dead... Resuscitate? I don't know. Certain things are conflicts with the people in our building because we're going to have to resolve some issues now with them. I've been avoiding it to some extent because I don't feel like I have the time or the inclination. There's also a source of conflict between me and Lauren. She doesn't know how to deal with it. So there, I find myself kind of caught. What is the best way to deal with it? Karen wants to take an aggressive stance. I, of course, want to avoid conflict. The one issue has been the people downstairs from us have a little bit of a larger space. They have the backyard. They have the lot, which we don't have access too. It's there's, essentially. So our contract is written so that some of our expenses are shared equally between, and some of our expenses are paid for based on... (13:12)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Square footage...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Square footage, or whatever. Whatever makes sense. As it was originally written, the building insurance was paid proportional to the amount of space. But what actually happened was everyone paid equally. It was something that was just missed for years and years. Karen picked up on it and said, "They've been underpaying." They came back with, the fact is, the insurance doesn't cover the lot. It covers the building. It only covers the building itself. So therefore, it should be equal. So this has become major bone of contention in there. And at any suggestion, they're up in arms over it. So it becomes this whole thing. Another issue is, we have a laundry room that we share with our next door neighbors. Our next door neighbors moved out and they rented the place. The people downstairs said, "Well, you can't allow the renters to use the laundry room." I was like, "Why?" They said, "Well, because there could be a flood." I said, "Well there could be a flood if we were there." And they said, "Well, no. Renters aren't the same (ph)." And they said, "Well we have a business down here on the first floor. If there's a flood, it could destroy our entire business. We'd be out of business. We'd wreck our computers..." Something like that... Just way out of proportion... I said, "If it's that valuable, you shouldn't rely upon.." "First of all", I said, "It would take a fairly specific set of events for that to happen. And if you were caught with your computers, they should be better protected just as a matter of course, if that's your lifeblood." (15:43)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's clear that they're sort of like...</p>

<p>PATIENT: There are always conflicts floating around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It seems like you're...</p>

<p>PATIENT: It just pisses me off in general that... It should be reasonable. It should be done as completely... The way it should be is...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The conflict shouldn't be there in the first place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There shouldn't be a conflict. I mean, they are right as long as it's true that the insurance is just for the building. Yes, it should be shared equally. But on the other hand, the laundry room has been there. I don't think a renter is going to... You know. But now, it's always like um... There's a lot of room for polarization. (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: As I'm listening to you share with me this whole big messy sort of thing, I sort of have two thoughts. One is, I was thinking back on your comment that Karen wants to take a stand and of course, you're going to use the words, "of course". You would take your standard position of avoiding conflict, making peace and getting it over with. That's sort of when I think it's like a situation you always find yourself in. You know, like this is something you're sort of used too. And like, here's this situation again. And you're sort of drawn to not wanting to be a part of it...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm frequently kind of called on to mediate or arbitrate situations because...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're the peacemaker.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The other thought I'm having though, is it's hard for me to get a sense of how I can be helpful with...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. It's like... There's no easy solution. There isn't one. The fact is, there are just some situations where nobody wins, sometimes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's frustrating.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is frustrating. But at the same time, I have to feel like I have a course of action. When Karen tells me that we've got to really press these, I just want to say, we're just going to end up making this a completely inflammatory... I know what will happen. There will just be this huge response from them that'll be unreasonable but paranoid and... (19:13)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So are you saying, if I'm hearing what you're saying, that you wish you could tell Karen something that you're not going to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) Yeah. I would like to be able to say to Karen, (and I have said it to her) that I believe that it is reasonable for them if that's the way the insurance is. Actually I had a way to verify that that was the case. Oddly enough, there was a wall behind the garden and the wall collapsed. So rather unwittingly, one of the women downstairs called and said that she was talking to the insurance company to see if she could collect insurance for it, which would have meant that the policy did indeed cover that. Therefore it was not... Also, it's been made more difficult because there's a single point of contact for the insurance company. That's the woman downstairs. They all, supposedly, only talked to her. But actually, I did call them up anyway. That's one thing that's difficult for me to do. Making a phone call like that is difficult for me to do. For some reason, I have a... There's something that pulls me back and perhaps it is having to do with a conflict. If I find out that something... I don't know what it is. This is something... I know that I have something that pulls me back sometimes from... It's almost like a lapse in judgment, in a way. In this case, I did make the call. I was talking to Karen, and I said, "Well we should call the insurance company and find out what the real deal is with this..." Actually, it was about something else. It was about an added charge - a charge that got added to our insurance bill which I knew nothing about. Karen immediately suspected that the people downstairs were up to some funny business and that they'd added something to our insurance. And actually, it's one of the cases where I'd recognized... I said, "Well, we should call the insurance company." Usually when I say that, I mean, she should call the insurance company (chuckles). But then I thought, "Why am I saying this?" I was about to leave for work, then I thought, "I can make this phone call." And I went and did it. But usually, I would not. My tendency would not be to act. It would be to just sort of let it slide. And if Karen would do it, great. And if she didn't, then nothing would happen. That's kind of a minor example, but I think there are a lot of things that I dislike doing. I dislike making reservations on the phone. Perhaps it has to do with asking. That's what it really has to do with - asking somebody for something. (23:09)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you took the words right out of my mouth. Just as you were talking... I had asked you probably like 10 minutes ago, if you had a sense of what you wanted from us and our work together.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Uh huh. Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And we ended up talking about this other thing, which is important, because it is a place...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then after going through the shaggy dog routine, where do we end up but back there...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I think it's hard for you in here to say what it is you'd like from me, what is it I'm not giving you or what you'd like me to do more of. What do you want this therapy to be about...</p>

<p>PATIENT: That is an issue. When I was going to counseling with Karen, that was an issue. It was like, well Cam, we know what Karen wants out of it. What more do you want? What are you asking for? And I couldn't think of anything. It's like, it's so hard for me to do that that I can't even compute it, I guess. I can't put it together in my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So if I said to you, Cam, what would you like to get from me, what would your answer be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'd like to get out of that bind, I guess. I'd like to be able to ask you for things and to have a better feeling or better idea of what I want, and be able to express it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How did that feel, telling me that, right now?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It felt good. It feels like it's right on. But I also feel like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was it hard, a little bit?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not hard in a... Not really. It's not like it's hard for me to say that once it's formulated. The formulation of it is what's difficult. The recognition of the thing... You know, to put things together in that succinct way. Normally I'm thinking, well what do I really want? And I hit this...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wall.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wall. So it's not that I can't give voice to it, or that there's a reluctance to give voice to it. It goes even farther than that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was a sense I had, and this could be about me and not about you... But there was a sense I had that when I labeled that and put you in that position by saying, "Okay Cam, what do you want?" </p>

<p>PATIENT: That I did...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There seemed like there was a little bit of uneasiness or embarrassment maybe. When the attention was turned on you, you sort of laughed a little bit when you said what you'd like to get from me. There was a little bit of embarrassment or... Maybe that's not the right word...</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I think maybe what's at play there is the wanting... Feeling a little bit, maybe, put on the spot and wanting to please or wanting to come through with something. Yeah. So it's sort of like the school kid who doesn't have the right answer to the question, or something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So like I caught you at something. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. In some ways. And not having the answer at my fingertips.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that like? Not having the answer at your fingertips makes you feel what? That you can't give me the right thing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, there's an embarrassment or there's... I don't know, really wanting to come up with something meaty or something, but at the same time running around in my head and not finding...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... what that may be.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...what that may be. And in fact, it's almost like, the more that happens, the harder it is. I'm just hitting a brick wall. And then I'm hitting it over and over again, and it's becoming bigger and bigger in some ways.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you have a sense of what you imagine my evaluation of you is going to be if you can't come up with the right answer? If I ask you for something and you're sort of stuck and you can't give it to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know that I think so much about what your reaction is going to be. It's a little difficult to say... It's more like it's this knee-jerk reaction. I kind of superimpose this thing of my father asking me a question and ridicule... (30:17)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He sure expected the right answer from you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. He did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And if he didn't get it, you knew about it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. And I'd be ridiculed or whatever. And even if I did come up with an answer...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It often wasn't good enough.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That sort of makes sense. Because when I push you to sort of share something with me, and now you feel like, "I've got to come up with an answer." The feeling you have associated with being in that place is embarrassment. It sort of follows it. Embarrassment means you're worried that the other person is not going to be welcoming or accepting. That there's going to be some sort of critical judgment of your if you're not able to come up with the right answer. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm thinking, what other things do I feel when that happens. I guess I think, "Why am I angry?" Or I think I should feel angry in some ways, or resentful. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Angry about what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: About being put on the spot. About if I have those feelings. But it's like, I've just got to come up with something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's a resentment about not being able to stand up for yourself and say, "Why are you pushing me," or Why..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's what I wonder. I'm not saying that...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping) Why are you asking me this. I don't know. Why are you pushing me?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that there is resentment there, but I think it's very deeply buried. I think it's the kind of thing that just is there at a low level. I kind of keep it simmering somewhere. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Has it happened between us where you've said to me, you don't know? Do you remember a time where you were just sort of like, "I don't know the answer to that?"</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it has happened once or twice, but in the main, (ph) no.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you really have felt this pressure to produce an answer?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And feeling that we are at this kind of juncture or this fork in the road. In some ways, perhaps it's like being called upon to justify why we should continue. I really do want to continue. There's also a side of me that wants to get away from it. But there's a side of me that really does want to continue. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you really have something there. In a way, that's part of what's happening, too. I think you have a sense of, "If this keeps going, what'll that mean?" Well, if this keeps going, maybe we'll get to deeper things. Maybe you're not 100 percent sure...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (overlapping) Maybe I'm not 100 percent sure I want to deal with that, yeah (chuckles).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you feel that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think that there's... And I don't know if you'd call it laziness also, but there's a certain amount of energy and there's a certain amount of... Whether I attribute that to you or myself or both, it still has to be expended. It's not like I can just go home and turn on the boob tube. In some ways I'd rather go home and turn on the boob tube and lose myself...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's hard work...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... than sit here and, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I do get that feeling. I think sometimes we sort of get into a place where we're really avoiding something. I don't always have the sense of, "What is it that we're avoiding right now," but I have that feeling sometimes, that there's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ... Like we're treading water somewhere or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And I think maybe that's why you keep saying, "Okay. So what are we doing now?" And I keep having these things come to my mind that we're at a juncture or we're turning the corner or something. Because I sort of have a feeling that there's something happening or something going on when the two of us are meeting, that somehow we're both working at not talking about or not getting to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That definitely happens. And I think it happens now in a different way than it might have happened earlier on. But it's still...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What feels different? Is there something specific?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, it's kind of more... I do feel like it's more of a dialogue now, where as before it was more as if I was just going off sometimes. Then I would go off into something that was just... Now, it's more like a dialogue, but sometimes I feel like... I don't know if it's manipulative, but in a sense, I think I steer things, in a way that... (36:07)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ... keeps us going down different paths...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Without really going into one things.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: My experience is having this vague sense like there are things we're not doing or we're not talking about. Do you have a clearer sense of what it is that we're not talking about, or is it really vague for you, too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's generally pretty vague also. When I was feeling more stressed, of course there were easy pickings. I could just point to this or point to that and say, "Here."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We can talk about that and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It's a hot button. It's right there. I mean, I still... There are things that we originally talked about. Those things are still present, I think - the passive behavior; the anger; the violent drawings... I still feel the urge to do them. I haven't had a lot of time but I think it's a function of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (overlapping) I have an idea. I'm sorry for interrupting, but I sort of have an idea about that. There's a sense in which there's so much safety in letting your anger and your sexual feelings and really strong feelings out in the drawings, because it's just you and the drawings.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So there's a real safety in there. There's also a specialness that it's just you. So I have a feeling that it's also somewhat, what we're not doing in here. It's not that we're not talking about the drawings, but we're not sort of letting your feelings out in here. There's passivity in here, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yes. But whereas in the drawings, you mean it is coming out there and that's my outlet?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mm hmm. I don't know, that's just a possibility.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to relate the one to the other. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like an abstract idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, but I know. Thing that are abstract can be... The mind is kind of abstract too, so... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, let me throw out an idea about what I think is something we could do if it feels like something that makes sense for you. What I think might be helpful for us to do more of is try to understand right in the moment as we are talking about things, what's happening and how you're feeling. It's sort of like a few minutes ago, when you were sharing with me what it was like for me to put you on the spot and say, "Okay, Cam. What do you want from me? Tell me what you want." And not because it's so important for you to give me the answer, but to talk about what did it feel like to be put in that position? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you shared that in part of you there's a little bit of resentment being put in that position and that you don't feel like you have a voice for that resentment. There's a little embarrassment. I don't know. That felt to me like we started to discover a little something. It didn't go maybe as far as it could go. I don't know. Did it feel that way to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We sort of were starting to learn something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I think so. I think it is also tied to my inability to ask for things, you know. And it is like... It's not the first time you've spoken about it for me to be in the moment to think... To be able to express what I'm feeling in the moment, that's very hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's the struggle. That's sort of like in a nutshell, the struggle that the two of us are confronting. That's the wall, maybe, that you described. I'm asking you to do a big thing. This is not a small thing. It's not like I'm saying, "Cam, just do that, will you?" (chuckles) And you could just magically do it and then everything would be fine. That's the struggle. I'm asking you to do something that's hard for you. But at the same time, I guess part of me feels like if there's a way that we could do it where maybe it would still feel hard but feel safe enough to take the risk to do it and see what happens. As long as there's a sense of, well, we can talk about whatever is happening. (41:54)</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's just more difficult in the sense that... I sort of feel like if it was a matter of being reticent about expressing. And perhaps that's part of it too, but I feel like, as I've said before, it kind of goes even beyond that. It goes beyond... I don't know if it's like deliberate obfuscation, within my own head.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's complicated. It's not like you have all this stuff and it's right there and you're just not saying it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, right. Like there's a little teleprompter in there that says, "Hmm, should I say that or should I not? (chuckles) But...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's the challenge in a way, I guess. It's not so that I get to hear what your feelings are. It's so that you get to sort of have a better idea of what they are. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A side benefit is I get to hear a little bit more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Hmm. Sometimes, I guess I... One thing I wonder is do people always know what they're thinking? Do people always know to give (inaudible at 43:24) to what they're feeling? I know that you certainly do key in to certain... You see my physical responses are my... I definitely cue things. I'm completely unconscious of them in a way, with a sigh or whatever.

There are things that are happening with you that are somehow not quite in your awareness. That you may feel something and then you have to turn the spotlight on it or really try hard to get a sense of what that is. But that's another way of... What matters is, if it feels to you like that would be worth while, knowing what you're feeling more of the time. In every single moment? I don't know. That seems like a really stringent, high goal there. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It sounds like maybe more than where you're at. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well, incremental if we could.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So we'll, same time next week?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yep.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good. Okay. (44:51)</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>Client no: 1429-110, Therapist: [inaudible], Interview 19, April 1, 1971. </p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible] there was anybody down here. 0:00:22.3</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right come on in. Do you want some coffee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, if you have it. Please. I've been sipping it all day, but. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How have you been your private whatever going to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, not working out very well at the moment. Muck a muck kind of, mental health, but disapproved for the depressed. So were still, there is supposed to be some kind of hearing before some kind of committee. I don't think it looks very good. 0:02:14.0 </p>

<p>PATIENT: And this thing is definitely on?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: What are you going to do with the building? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well this building is for the whole psychology department, not only the counseling center. And I think that most of the offices of the counseling center will be taken over by the college psychology staff and faculty. Right now it's pretty much taken up by the graduate department.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What about the people that are in treatment?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well they can't be seen here any longer. I supposed that some of them transfer to other places. Some of the staff are in private practice or will go into it and perhaps, you know, their clients will continue with them. Some people will terminate their therapy. 0:03:19.7 </p>

<p>PATIENT: What are you going to do?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I want, well I have, I have a couple of job prospects for next year and I will also see people privately as I already do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do, so you see them here? Or -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well what I was wondering like, is go in like next time right after.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: For an - just to clarify in my own head. Will I, after the 20 sessions, do I have to then take these tests all over again. 0:04:16.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: yes. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And. Put it this way do I have an option to go on? Or do I have still until the last, the last minute of the last taping.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think that the only, the only thing we can say about that is that we should try to negotiate whatever we can after you have taken the test.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Wells then it would be up to me to like contact you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, and then we'd have to decide, you know, what if anything what, what should be done. But so far as this, the original contact is concerned, your next session is the last session. 0:05:04.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Can I just ask you one thing?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What do you charge for individual sessions?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Twenty dollars.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay I can get your number or something. You'd still be here right. [inaudible] Well I kept in mind some for your points from last, from last week. You left off with this thing about limiting. 0:06:05.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What are you talking about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: From, from therapy from last week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Limiting?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not trying to do everything in the world. Which I don't if I, I guess I. Even through the course of things, you know, I think I could done some of this stuff. Like one thing, one thing I happen to think about it was that this group I sing in, the Soprano Club, I sing some very difficult things. Which I can't really hack. I go in there and I, well I sit kind of like in fear that, that the ax is going to fall and they're going to discover that I'm not nearly at really [inaudible]. And it's like, I think I am going to postpone that until the first fall next year [inaudible] which I know backwards and forwards, so I'm just going to not sing the spring concert. Because I think in order to sing that, you know, like I should almost take voice lessons and stuff like that. And the only other thing I've been working on is this [inaudible] thing. 0:07:28.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Loosing weight.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh yeah, I've lost about, I didn't really start until Monday, but I lost about another five pounds.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I started on my diet on Monday also. But I'm not following my weight, I'm having a friend do it for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You can resist looking at a scale every day?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I, I've gotten to the point when I felt so god damn fat that I was embarrassed to look at the scale. I didn't even want to know how much I weighed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [Chuckling] Why, why did you start last Monday?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was the day after my birthday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, a new beginning kind of.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: You do that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure why not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know, which one are you on? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it's really a kind of combination of low calorie, it's like a modified Stillman (sp?) diet except I'm not drinking all that water - </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: - that he, you know, talks about. And its not just protein, there is some carbohydrates, but it's very limited. You know, just like maybe half a slice of bread a day. No butter. No fats. </p>

<p>PATIENT: No potatoes or</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No potatoes. None of that stuff.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Do you, what kind of meat?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Any kind. Well on Monday I had steak. Last night I had some turkey that I broiled. Eggs, boiled eggs. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah that's-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Cheese.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No beer? Are you a beer drinker? 0:09:19.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not too much, I'm more of a wine drinker. Or, you know, cocktail drinker. I have to stay away from that stuff too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Are you married?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Lots of black coffee. No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, see that what I think would be the bind, if you were married. Because what I, well, my friends that are married say when they, you know, when they come home at night. If their wife, well if their wife is a cook, but if she's not cook then there's no [inaudible]. But if she can cook, like I got this one new friend weighs about 2-, I think he's up 250 now. But he's really, you know he really is, you know its. I don't, I don't know why he wants to do that. Because he doesn't like it himself. I never thought that much of another weight before, but, but the last I got [inaudible]. But I am, I am just on a straight Stillman thing. Expect I, well last night, if you drink at all, I went out sipping [inaudible]. I got into one of them places where there is peanuts. 0:10:36.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's murder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I know. That's the worst thing I can take. It's like [inaudible]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think the most difficulty that I have of the Stallman thing is just you [inaudible] end up much variety when you sit down to something like. It's very difficult for me to have a steak and cottage cheese for example, but very easy, much easier to be able to have a steak and a salad. Even with a very little bit of salad dressing on it. I don't have to have gobs of it. That really makes the meat much more pleasurable for me. I have cottage cheese every god damn meal. You know, I like cottage cheese every once in a while, but when that's all you eat. 0:11:25.3</p>

<p>PATIENT: I told myself, I said I'd, I'd stay on it really strict and play basketball until the 15th. Usually if I play basketball I loose a lot of weight. Because I've been doing this like for about eight months. I'm fooling around with. I said either I do this time or I admit that I'm not going to loose any more weight and I'll just stay here and buy all my clothes at this weight. Because I've been, like these clothes, you've probably noticed I've had three pair of pants. This one, a green pair and other pair, that's all I ever where, you know, the same three clothes. And they're just, they're really kind of worn out. And they have been taken it from what they were before.</p>

<p> That's my major concentrating thing that I am working on. Plus the diet and the exercise. I didn't drop any of the classes, kept my classes. But I haven't been to the bars all that much. I can't. I was here Thursday last week, right. 0:12:45.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uh hum.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wasn't sure it was Thursday. Like I was thinking when I was driving, I'm really undecided about, you know, what I'm trying. I don't know what this for, you know like I was sitting here before and I was looking at these books. And I have never, I've looked at those books a lot, like if I don't look at you I'm looking over there. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And I have sorted out until when you went for that coffee one book title. You know. The only one I know is Utopia, is there something like that, maybe its cause I can't see. It's the only book title. Maybe just because I can't see. It's the only book title I have ever sorted out and I must have looked at that thing a thousand times in the times that I have been here. [inaudible]. </p>

<p> Anyway, what I was going to. Like I wrote down some of the things from the earlier sessions. And ever since the 14th session, I haven't written all that much. Here lately again. But it's like a, it's like a cycle. 0:14:15.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Usually when I write, I write because I have to write. You know I write because if something bothering me and I've got to think about. And it's bothering me enough so that I do. Well nothing is bothering me that much, then I don't write that much. It's either that or its that I, you know what ever my unconscious things, I don't want to look at those things. And I'm not sure which is which. But like up through 12 or 13 I wrote a lot about things that I thought about. In session 14 I didn't write that much and then from then on up until maybe the last two I started writing again. It's almost like I go through cycles of where, where I can't understand why I do things to cycles to where this doesn't bother me so much. You know most of the time I still can't understand, I still can't. For example. Last Thursday after this session my friend Kathleen from Maine was down here. And she stayed the night at my place. And we were talking - 0:15:49.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That is the one that is moving to New York ?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she's coming, she's the girl that I </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh she hasn't moved here yet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. She's coming. Well she just had a job interview and I think she'll get a job, [inaudible] at the Institute of Jewish Juvenile Research. And that's where, and she's back again tonight. I supposed to pick her up tonight because she has an interview there tomorrow again. So I think she'll come back. But anyhow she was here and - in some way. See its still like I don't, I don't like a girl. Or I really get, how do I want to say it, upset. Not even upset, I don't know how to. I don't experience like what I call feelings. You know gutsy kinds of things. Unless there is some element of uncertainty or that I can almost sense that the other person wants to like hurt me. </p>

<p>And [inaudible] we were, I guess that we were talking in bed. And she said, I don't know how we got on the subject. But anyhow I found out she was on birth control pills which I didn't know before because we never screwed in the whole length of time that I've known her. And I wanted to know how long she'd been on birth control pills. And she said since October. I says why did you go, why'd you get the pills in October. Because she I started dating her back in July. So I [inaudible] as soon as she said that, my reaction was - 0:18:03.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who has she been screwing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well yeah. Which, you know, is she. But then I pressed her on that. And she said she got involved with a guy in October and it lasted until, well it was the end of October and it lasted till about December. Somebody from school. And what I think rankled me, although see I didn't show it that much because I said something like. I think the strongest I would have said, you know, another words you would like, you know, take pill for some other guy but you wouldn't for me. This, this is pretty much what I said, well that's what I did say. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Was that true?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think it was true. I mean like I dated her in the summer 0:18:54.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And she wouldn't go to bed with you then.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, she'd go to bed, but we'd never screw. You know she'd always draw the line. And, I didn't see that. I was done there right at the beginning of, I've been down there I think three times. Once when she came in, you know, and she just went down to Ann Arbor. And once, it was right about the end of October. And at that time, you know, I asked her, you know, it wasn't just that we weren't, you know, like physical at all. It was just she was very cold. And I asked her like was there some other guy and she said no. And now, well now she said, you know like, at this time that there was another guy, but she had just met this guy who she started, you know. Going to bed with. And then I was down there, around, oh no, she came up here around Christmas time. And at that point she had broke up with him and then I went down there, this is about the middle of February. And then things, and then she just, then she was all up in the air about being confused and where she wants to go. This is when I told her that I love her. So then, well anyway last week she was all worried about how I felt about her now. And I was confused, like I didn't know. 0:20:45.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You aren't sure how you feel about her now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I, its different than before. At least now, you know like one thing I told her, I said, thing is, you know, like I'm all into the current stuff now. But I said "I'm sure if you wouldn't have told me something like that, you know, I'm sure I would have found something". You know I would have found something that would have given me some kind of cause. Like it was almost like, so I can get out of this deal. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like those words no longer rang true for you. You don't love her now. So were trying to find way to get out of that commitment that made [inaudible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: Its almost, its almost like the same old thing of like where now I can, and I don't even think I'm right in being hurt, but I feel hurt. And therefore because I feel hurt, I have now given up. I owe her nothing and I get out of it. 0:21:52.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what you are saying is that you would find something that would help you get of, you would have found something that would help you get out of the relationship, no matter what. Whether she'd been to bed with somebody else or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's almost like I would be searching.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Searching for some flaw, something that when I could say, okay you're not perfect so</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So goodbye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But that does, that doesn't even get out. Because when she told me this stuff. For some reason she felt she had a mention. You know that she was on the pills and it was some way that I, I was bugging her. There was something I was doing, so she had to say that. And then once she did, then I badgered her, but very much, about you know like when. 0:22:58.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: when she was on them, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or why. And then when she told me. Then she was really hesitant and she started crying about telling me it and then all I could, all I could do was lay there like and idiot and I couldn't do nothing. And I couldn't, that's what I couldn't understand. I couldn't understand. I couldn't understand why I was feeling that way. Like what I wanted </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So helpless you mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. What I wanted to do was when she told me that I wanted to just turn over and go to sleep and not talk at all. And you know not even, just pretend she wasn't there. And then I said to my self that if I did that. That's like running away, that's like, that not like, it's like not going to be able to talk. And so then. 0:23:44.6 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What not being fair to her, not being fair to yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not yet, right, not being fair to each other. You know like not. Because I have had those things and when I follow those things its like with Susie. When I follow that I just get miserable. And I don't talk about it. But then when, you know, like I tried to explain to her what I was feeling and I really, I really had a hard time. The only way I could, I could try to explain it. See in the moment I couldn't react and I thought about this like during this week. And the only thing is now, is like, you know, it's like you just wait until you want to screw and I'm not going [inaudible]. It's like [inaudible] </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting back at her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right, you know, because you know we could have been screwing all along for what ever the hell it was worth. 0:24:48.5</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it could have very enjoyable and you could have had a better relationship than if she had screwed with somebody else first.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that, I think more I was pissed about was the fact that, you know, that I was so dumb that I didn't, well, like you know we could have been screwing. Only she just didn't want to. And, well part of it is too, she would with someone else, but she wouldn't with me. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. What does that say to you about you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it says either that I wasn't worth it. Her explanations of why not was that- 0:25:45.2 </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm sure that you didn't believe what she told you anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: no, I didn't want, no not. But see I didn't [inaudible].</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You still feel like second best, huh.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well that's part of it yeah. It's like almost now, you know, like. See my head tells me, you know, like I don't think she's a plotter. My emotions tell me that it's almost as like though the end of the year is coming. She's got to go somewhere and since I am still around she can come here. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're thinking to yourself to hell with that. I'm not going to play second fiddle to anybody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That is the same thing as before. 0:26:33.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But there is a way in which you seem to feel guilty or wrong about that too, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah because I don't, I don't really feel that she was dishonest to me. You know, it's like two things going on at once.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah it was good that she was honest with you and told you about it. On the other hand that marred her for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: That what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Marred her. Made her less desirable because it felt like [inaudible - overlapping talking]</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible] No it makes her more desirable in a way. Because she succeeded in - 0:27:15.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because now she'll screw.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Because she's succeeded in evoking something me like - See it's, you know, it a mind boggler. Because it, it makes me react in a level that I am no good at reacting.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean? What level is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Emotional level, you know like she's got me beat hands down on that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's why you have to say goodbye to her. Or that's what you usually do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because on an emotional level. Like for instance, you know like all this time. For instance that during that time, the exact time when she was with this guy. That is when I was involved with Susie. And right when, even when she came back for New Year's Eve, it was a debate in my head between Susie and Kathleen. And I wound up asking Susie out first for New Year's Eve, then Susie couldn't go, so I asked out Kathleen. Well Kathleen already had a date she said. You know, so I was doing the same thing and I think I was pretty involved with Susie. Enough so that I really, I really I wrecked my head for while. 0:28:37.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I guess that what you are saying is that it seems unfair to have a double standard like this. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah right, because and I told her that. You know, </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't feel the same way. It feels like it was wrong for her to sleep with somebody else first. Or with somebody else at all.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh no. I think I wouldn't have minded her sleeping with somebody else as long as she was sleeping with me. You know if then she wants to fine. You know in a way. 0:29:07.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay so, what did her sleeping with you last Thursday do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh we still didn't screw or anything like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she had an excuse, so she said. You know she said she was in her period and she doesn't screw in her period. Or she doesn't screw in the beginning part of her period is what she exactly said. Which [inaudible] I might not. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what is going to happen tonight?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm not. See that where, that where I really, words I can words but when it </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: what do you want to happen tonight? 0:29:53.8</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. See I screwed up my head I start getting marriage in it. So alright. Its like now I've got, it's like I want to give. I want to give to one girl but I am effectively prevented because there are two girls that I think I like. Enough so that I don't want to hurt either one. But in Kathleen's case in a way, I'd really like to hurt her. See I don't, I just- Like when she got done with all this stuff. You know telling me about. And I said well then I just didn't know how to act. I didn't I feel, she was crying and I put my arm around her. But I didn't really have my heart in that shit. And so I said. Well I don't know. We talked for a while and then I just mentioned that I feel really, I really feel mixed because at the time that this was going on, it was going on with me. As she just said that made her feel really jealous but not angry. Because I thought I felt angry. But see I don't even know how to distinguish between when I am feeling angry and when I am feeling jealous. I don't even know that those are different.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well what did you feel last Thursday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think more hurt than anything else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so then you know how you felt.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but it was there was -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Except you couldn't tell her, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: In a way I did, yes.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean in a way you did?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I tried to explain, see that, when I think about it maybe then things come clearer. But when I'm, when I'm right there. I didn't just roll over and go to sleep. Because I said, I knew in my head that that was no good. And I tried to explain. What did I try to explain? She asked me a couple of times if my feelings had changed. And she said things like she hoped they didn't change. Then she asked me why I had told her that I love her. And I'm not sure, I can't remember what I said. I'm not sure that I said because I do, I think I answered her that it was really hard. I guess not [inaudible]. It was hard for me, you know like, if I was talking to her to really, you know like, say my emotions or say what I feel or even many times to know what I feel. And then I tried to explain like what it was that, that made me feel now the way I was feeling. And the only way that I could do that was to try to explain to her how fearful I am about, about. 0:34:05.2</p>

<p>Well about getting close to somebody. And then I just told her, you know like, the thing that happened today, at school, where I saw I was eating in a restaurant and I saw a bunch of teenagers. This is out in Coney Island they were all smoking and everybody was talking back and forth. And really continuous of, you know, everybody else noticing, paying attention to what they were doing. It was like if one person moved, they all moved. They kept in this cohesive group and these sorts of things. But when I was a teenager, you know, I never had, I never was that, I was never part of a group. And I've never been part of, of a thing where I really felt especially when I, I remember all the way through up until second year of college I never felt that I was a part of things. And that I belonged. And that, that I really even reach out for people. </p>

<p>And I tried, I guess what I was trying to say that is why it is really hard for me to even try to come close to you. Because, I'm just not, I'm not used to it and I never. I've got all these things that I don't know why. You know, I can't believe that that's, that I can maybe even do that. Because of a lot of stuff about ever belonging to someone or some group. 0:36:06.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You just don't know how to do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I've always, you know, I've always, I've always really been a loner. And</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: how does that make you feel?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like I want to belong to somebody. I want to belong, I want to belong to something. You know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean that you feel lonely?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you want to belong to something or somebody, but you just don't know how to go about it. You don't know what to do. Never had the experience. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I can, I can say in words that I want to belong to somebody. But to allow myself, like, now feel something in my stomach. But to allow - 0:37:02.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you can't let yourself relax somehow or feel free enough to give yourself into somebody.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah that, that would come close to it. Because I don't know. It's like if I would, then they have power over me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you might loose the little bit of yourself that you have. Is that the way that it feels?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Its almost like if, it's like something holds me back. And it's almost like if, like with Kathleen, like maybe there, you know, maybe, I'm working at it. Maybe I'm working at it, you know, like too hard and maybe what, maybe that it isn't the way my emotions work. Maybe I have to have something where, where it's kind of it mind blowing. And maybe I'm cheating both her and myself to try, to try to even let myself go. 0:38:30.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: you can't. I guess what it sounds like your saying is that you can't force yourself to relax, you just have to relax. It has to happen by its self. The more that you try it doesn't help.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It's like the other time. When I told her that I loved her then, that was pretty, I was surprised. You know that I even said that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Very spontaneous, huh?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I mean because first of all I thought well maybe, you know, maybe I'm just doing this, you know, to see if I can do it. If I can do, well then I've passed that test and I can go on along the road. But the way that it came out, it wasn't like I had planned it, to say that. I think partly what scares me too, I think there is this unconscious things that I don't know about that, that I am not certain about. It almost like if I have to, I have to watch myself to insure. Well kind of to insure myself that if I let myself go, I might like almost act in hurtful ways toward her. It's like not really knowing. 0:40:08.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I really did wrong kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no. What I think, I think what it is what I do something that is deep within me that I don't trust. It's like I would, like there is a part of me within me that wants to hurt Kathleen and not love her. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [Phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello, hello. Yeah this is part of it. Right. Are you on campus? Uh huh. It may be that is nobody down there. Could I help you, or? Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay, I'll try to give him a message but in the mean time I'll transfer you to the reception desk and you can let them know also. Okay? Okay, hold on. Yeah, could you transfer this call to 2360 please. 0:41:37.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Alright. What I was saying is like. It's like there is a part of me that I am afraid that I can't recognize it. And it's almost like I fear that part. Because to be that part is malicious and hurtful. Like with Kathleen. What did I say, oh the other night she called me on the phone to say when she was coming in. And I didn't, I don't' know why I made this comment. This is what gets, this is what gets me. I said, she was talking for a while and I said "well somebody has got to watch the amount of time that you spend on the phone so that you can pay your bill". As though she couldn't do that herself. And all I know is that I have seen some of her phone bills are astronomical. But maybe that is just because I am tight, you know. Of her parents, you know, her parents. Not so much her father but her god damn Jewish mother, is really a Jewish mother. I'm like geez, I mean she even tells me about it. Or maybe it's the fact that she's Jewish. You know, the farthest thing from my own traditional approach to things. You know I just wonder, like maybe I'm anti-Semitic or something like. Maybe I've got that in the back of my head. Or what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible]</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I said I've never heard you say that you've been wrong about anything. You know. But she hasn't been most of the time. She rarely makes mistakes. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But the point is that she won't admit it even though she is.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never heard her say that she has been wrong about anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like some adolescent stubborn kid. 0:43:56.6</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well she's got a little way and I, one of the things that I always watch is, you know, is if she manipulating. If she's manipulating to get her ends. Okay well I don't know. Sometimes I really feel she is. And so I'll say it, are you manipulating me? And she'll oh you know no. Like she told me, I make her defensive sometimes about, you know, about. Well she asked me if I could take a suitcase, she asked me if she brought a suitcase from her parents could I take it back for her. And she says that isn't why I invite you down for the weekend. </p>

<p>But it was like I would think, you know, she's just using me and she doesn't really want to see me. And allot of the, I guess is what I kind of believe. It's like when, it's when the closer I get to her and the closer I get to any girl. The more I can't believe that they would, you know, that they would just like me for what I am. I can believe that with my head but I can not believe that emotionally. And I guess what I am afraid of is that I'll act like a little kid. If I really act like I feel, I'm acting like a little kid.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that like? What's a little kid like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's like if, if immature, or that not the word. The other thing that is right with me. 0:46:11.6</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Manipulative?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: no.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't understand how you mean.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I'm just wondering whether that, you know, that characteristics of little kids is that they manipulate people.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No I'm talking about myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah I know. I am asking you whether you would be concerned about manipulating other people or whether you would try to manipulate Kathleen. 0:46:39.5</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I think I do, I think I do, I think I did that. I think I manipulate her but I don't manipulate her, you know like openly, I would be [inaudible]. You know, where I couldn't even recognize what I was doing, that I was doing something. But the thing I was trying to get at was is I really- It like when, I don't do the other thing that comes to my head is when I was in high school once and I really liked this one girl, I had a crush on her. And it came down for gym time and it was, we had square dancing in gym. And I, I guess she had asked me a couple of times and I had asked her. And I was almost tempted to ask her out once. But for me in high school that would have been unbelievable. And later that week, there was some big function coming up. But a friend, I saw them together, and he had asked her out. And I felt you know like, I didn't feel, I felt kind of like a hurt. But I didn't feel angry or anything like that. I just felt like running away. 0:48:29.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What she should have chosen you even though you didn't ask her out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like in some way, yeah in some way. [inaudible]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible].</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some way I expected it but I never gave her any opportunity, you know, I didn't go talk, I didn't exert myself. You know, I didn't put out. I didn't take any risks. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were afraid to take that risk.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: yet you suffered the consequence of having taken it and lost anyhow.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just heard this expression last night like, what is it. Never even thought to it quite that way. But a fair maiden is never won by a faint lover. You know I said, you know, well hell I've never. I've never in my whole god damn life really, you know, see something that I wanted to do, really go after [inaudible] and really gone after 'em. It's always been I've either stumbled in. 0:49:33.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Never been anything but a faint lover. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Shoot yes, they make the decisions, I don't make the decisions. But, well there's something about me that usually, you know, usually I stumble on good things once, well occasionally. But, you know, I don't know if I ever get the choice. And I think if do, well then-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then what? You wouldn't know what to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well it's like with, it's like with Kathleen right now. If -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: - it's like I'm feeling like I'm really mismatch on emotions with her. 0:50:27.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You give up so easily.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I do, I really do. And that [inaudible] and only when it comes to emotionally.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well listen why don't you five it a chance? Maybe you're right and maybe your not. </p>

<p>PATIENT: And you know I just don't know why it is there. Almost everything else I will, you know, especially athletics, I'll hang in. But emotionally, geez I just feel like I'm really-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: [inaudible] Thursday. Thursday next week is no good for me until 6 instead of 5 is that okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, let's see, what is that? 0:51:24.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's April 8th.</p>

<p>PATIENT: [inaudible] Yeah that okay, that's Wednesday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Thursday. I may be a little bit late even for that. 6:15.</p>

<p>PATIENT: yeah I'll, will there be a receptionist then?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, she comes back on around 5:15.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. 0:52:03.7</p>

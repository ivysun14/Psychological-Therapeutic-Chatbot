<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I had something happen last night and I'm not too
sure exactly what the cause is.  But I think, I think I was, uhm, well, I
felt quite sick once I went to bed last night.  And I'd been working on a
paper, another paper for my course, which is due this Thursday.  And I was
feeling under a lot of pressure because, as usual, I was making the job way
too big for myself and then feeling I couldn't get it done.  And so when I
felt sick I just thought it was tension from that.  And I thought it would
go away.  But it didn't and I ended up being up a good part of the night. 
And while I was awake I was just aware of having what I talked about
yesterday coming back to my mind again and again almost as if that was a
part of the tension.  And I hadn't thought of it.  And the whole thing
disturbed me too because I was hoping, in a way, that I would feel ill so
then I could find an excuse not to go to school.  And this is something
I've never done before.  But after not getting very much sleep and still
not feeling very well I used the excuse, but I knew in a way it was just
kind of a trick my mind was playing to set up the situation so I wouldn't
feel too guilty.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How did you feel sick?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I felt nauseous but I ended up having diarrhea and then having
cramps and everything.  It was bad enough so I couldn't — and I didn't
know whether something else had happened too or if it were just tension. 
(Pause) And I also think, it must have been last night — maybe some of the
dreams I've had were before last night but I'm aware of dreaming about all
sorts of different people or things that mean something to me, or, well, my
cats, uhm, dying.  In particular I can remember what I must have dreamt
last night, my cats dying.  But it just seems like I'm running through all
the different people or things that are important to me and having
something happen to them.  (Pause) 
 
ANALYST: What, what, what happens?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I can't remember beyond with my cats.  But, well, actually they
were squeezed to death, in a way, the way it happened.  And this made me
think that the dream I used to always have with my mother.  It was the same
thing, that she'd be being squeezed in a gate.  And somehow it makes me
think of something that is a vague feeling.  And I was thinking about it
yesterday too.  And I, it was so vague I didn't even feel I could, I knew
what to say about it.  But it's another feeling I have of, if MSCZ's on top
when we're having intercourse, of sometimes it just seems like the pressure
of his body is overwhelming and almost as if I'm being squeezed to death. 
(Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: You, eh, the dream that you think you had last night about the,
about your cats, it was the cats who were being squeezed to death, is that
what you meant?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yes.  Well, uhm, I'm not too clear on exactly how it was happening but
the only memory I have of it now is that they were in, crawling into an opening, almost as if they were crawling through a thing in a fence.  And I
think something else seems to have gotten in there too and then there were
just, there wasn't room.  But all I can re_, remember is sort of the visual
effect I had of whatever they were in becoming tighter and their screaming. 
(3-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, the way I feel here is similar to the way I so often feel
when I'm having to write a paper.  And if I'm under the pressure of time
and maybe other pressures, it's just sort of a feeling that I can't seem to
get anywhere and I suppose too a feeling that I'm not controlling my mind. 
And I end up, both here and just today when I've been working on my paper,
feeling that I have some ideas somewhere but they're just so vague and
confused and I can't seem to straighten them out.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>I was thinking, too, about a part of the paper I just did, which was
clear to me to a point but I obviously didn't have the same feeling about
what I'd said today that I had when I wrote it last night.  And I just put
it in anyway because I had had some feeling about it and I didn't know what
to do if I didn't put it in.  And it just seems that so often when I'm
doing a paper I start out with a simple sort of clear idea of what I want
to do and then I get so involved in trying to put everything into it that I
completely lose track of what I'm trying to do and confuse myself and lose
all judgment on whether or not what I'm saying makes any sense.  And I feel
sort of trapped because I don't have time to start over again.  And my use
of English becomes very confused.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What was your idea for this paper?  What's it about?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  It's comparing different, uhm, books on teaching art that I've read. 
And I think the point we were supposed to work on is what in the different
books seemed important to us or meant something to us.  And I began doing
that and then it just seemed that I was being so general that I started
trying to be more specific, which meant I almost felt as if I were
repeating the books but in my own words.  (Pause) And there was so much I
didn't know about teaching art or hadn't thought out about what a program
could be, that it seemed like there was an awful lot in every book I read
that meant something to me.  And I wasn't selecting the most important
things or I wasn't seeing where I'd already said an idea once enough so
that I didn't really have to say it another way.  But, I, even if I know
this, I can't seem to go through what I have written and, and take out
things that don't need to be there.  Like it too in the attitude I've
always had about turning in papers, at least.  (Pause)</p>

<p>I think something else about it is bothering me too, which I don't
really like to admit.  And that is that we were given a choice of how many
books we read, but it had to be at least three.  And some of the books are
not very long so his implication was if you're reading short books then
you'd probably read more.  And I read a short book but, uhm, have only just
started my 4th one and I won't even get into it enough to really write
anything on it.  And for some reason, I'm, I think I feel that what I do is
totally unacceptable because of that.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I think I was feeling a little frantic yesterday, too, because I
had thought I had two weeks after this to write reports on the children and
found out yesterday I only had one week.  And all I can remember is how it
took me forever last year.  So I'm already anticipating a horrible time and
just have this feeling I won't be able to do it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And too, this morning when I knew that I felt badly enough so I was
tempted not to go to school, I still had to sort of have MSCZ make the
decision for me by asking him what he thought I should do and, I don't
know, just having his support in my deciding not to go.  (Pause) Even if
I'm legitimately sick, I was just thinking of how I always find it hard to
make the decision not to go to school.  (Pause) I suppose that's because I
feel I'm not going to be accepted for a lot of reasons, but if I'm faithful
in my attendance then it's one thing I can control or can win approval on. 
(Pause) And it's sort of strange too because on the one hand I know it's
not going to be what I win approval on and yet by not going, I fear
bringing down disapproval on myself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And something like it too in the attitude I've always had about
turning in papers, at least all through high school and college.  I was
horrified at the thought that I might not get it done on time because it
just had to be in by the deadline.  And I always felt this in spite of
seeing lots of other people turning in things late and having absolutely
nothing happen.  And there was just one time at RZG when I did turn in some
things late.  And it, I don't know, I just felt everything had just gotten
totally out of my control.  (Pause) And there's something, I'm just
thinking, in both not going to school and in turning in the papers late in
making the decision that was very hard but once I'd made it, it was, I
don't know, sort of nice.  Even though I still had a lot of pressure to get
the papers done, there was a certain relief felt and then I think I felt
guilty because somehow I wasn't exercising self-discipline enough. 
(3-minute silence)</p>

<p>It's funny, all I can think about here, really, is being just
oppressed by the thought of what I have left to do and the thought, also,
that I might have to be up pretty much all night.  And I suppose that the
whole time I'm doing the paper this is what's on my mind too, which keeps
anything else from coming to it.  I just can't seem to get that fear out of
my mind then.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, I gathered that the things you do think about you, I mean in
connection with the paper, you don't feel are something to be said here?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  No, it's really just sort of a visual memory of looking at the sheet I
know I have to go back to and just how it isn't fully written out.  It's
phrases more than sentences and has to have a lot of organization done to
it.  And all I can just see is this mess, this sheet of paper, knowing that
I'm feeling so frantic and then trying to work that out.  (Pause) And I've
sometimes wondered, too, why, when I feel this way — and I was just
thinking of sometimes when I'm sitting in front of the typewriter and I
just feel totally confused by what I'm looking at and feeling frantic —
why I don't just simply forget what I have and simplify and start over.  So if I'm going to end up writing a garbled mess then I might as well write
simply a few things, even if isn't including everything.  But I never do.
(Pause)</p>

<p>And I suppose, too somewhere in the back of my mind is always this
fear of not knowing exactly what's expected but being sure I'm not going to
do whatever it is.  (Pause) And then I'll ask myself, well, why does that
matter.  And why can't I stand once not doing what's expected and maybe
failing or something.  And I, when I think of it that way, I think, well, I
mean, one time out of so many it won't matter.  But still I can't, I can't
accept it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I've wondered, too, what happens to make everything get so
confused because if I, when I was reading these books things seemed to be
clear and I knew exactly what was impressing me.  And I think if I talked
to my professor about them I could be fairly clear.  But somehow writing it
down just seems so different.  And something happens to me when I have to
do that.  (Pause) And the other thing that we have to do for the course is
make up two questions which concern us and (clears throat) ones we'd like
discussed.  And I've just had so many questions all throughout the term. 
But because he's going to have our names put next to the questions, I
can't, it's, I can think of some but it's almost as if my mind has gone
blank on that too.  I'm so afraid of having my name against something that
will look stupid.  (Pause)</p>

<p>It's almost as if, throughout this whole thing there's something in me
saying I'm stupid and I can't do it and I'm incapable and then another part
of me has to sort of fight back and say, "yes you can do it.  Keep at it. 
And you're not stupid and at one time you had some ideas so you must still
have them."  And I'm so busy with this struggle that I can't do anything
else.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: Do you think part of the difference between writing it down and
talking with the instructor, if you write it down all ahead of time then
there it is and you can't modify it if you s—, sense that he doesn't like
this or that idea, whereas if you're talking to him you could modify what
you say as you go along?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, I think that's part of it.  And I think that the other part of it
is that something, the expectations are greater if you had time to write it
down, whereas if you're just talking to a person the ex—, somehow the
expectations aren't the same.  Although I think probably the bigger part is
feeling, well, then I can figure out what he is expecting by the way he
asks me things or the way the conversation goes.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: As you try to do here often, hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT:   Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST: I mean, to figure out what I expect.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Umhmm.  Even to the point where your suggesting what you just did —
and it was something that I hadn't thought of in terms sort of giving an
oral report on a book.  But yet, it seems to be very clear that that would
be my reaction.  And then I was afraid that I was agreeing mainly because
you had suggested it.  I sort of end up not knowing how I think about
something.  I think it happened the other day too when the, there was some
parallel between — I think it was Monday or Thursday, I can't remember
which but — now I can't even remember what it was.  But you drew, you drew
a parallel between something I'd been talking about and something I was
doing.  (Silence)</p>

<p>It's so funny.  I wonder why I forgot that.  I don't really trust
myself.  I'm sure I haven't forgotten it.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, maybe it'll come back.  Our time's up.</p>

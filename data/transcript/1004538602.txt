<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Did you wash your hands?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ian does the same thing. He's like in and out like that, and I'm like "did you wash your hands?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughter)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know he didn't. (pause) I'm just exhausted. Running around, dealing with making sure I'm there for the phone guy at the office. Stupidly I left my computer there at the office and went to E&G thinking I'd go back afterwards, but I just felt so shitty after E&G that I went home.</p>

<p>[00:59.5]</p>

<p>Because I didn't have my computer, I really couldn't respond to things. I'm actually starting to get some title orders come in, so it's like I need to go up there and start doing them. But Jess has got a brief due, so she wants me to pick up Ian (sp?) today. It's never — when I have work, I'm never given credit for it. When I pick up the kids, I'm never given credit for it. I'm always just the one who doesn't support the kids. I've been asking her for weeks to get stuff that The bank wants for the modification. One of the things they want is a lease at the house that's in her name, they want it in my name.</p>

<p>[01:56.8]</p>

<p>And one of the things they suggested to me was — because basically I put the income on the request for modification affidavit, so they're like "there's income there but it's not in his name." I don't know. They're too dense and stupid to make logical leaps. So when I called back — they keep calling me, and I call back and this lady suggested I get a letter from Jess saying that all of the rent is contributed to the household income. So when Jess was telling me (inaudible at 00:02:38) political problems with all the girls upstairs and getting this signed, whatever, I sent her an e-mail "well, why don't you write a letter stating that." And she replies back "I don't understand what you're asking me for," even though I pretty much gave her the quote "put this in a letter and sign it."</p>

<p>[03:03.3]</p>

<p>And she puts on there "is this because" — she still is fixated on thinking that this is all about The bank evaluating whether she can make the payment. She's not on the fucking note. They don't give a shit about her. I can't get it through her fucking head that this isn't about her. She's not involved at all, and that's why they don't want her fucking name on there. I couldn't even respond. I was just like, I asked for a simple task. The CPA didn't e-mail me but I said they e-mailed me my tax forms. They didn't. I have an envelope dated the 17th, so I'm sort of okay there.</p>

<p>[03:51.9]</p>

<p>I call her asking for Lucille's social security number, the address of her nanny, the social security number of her nanny. All this information she's supposed to have because they [got] Lucille off the tax forms. She said "I'll send it to you." She never sent it to me. I don't know when she's going to send it to me. I've got to get to the CPA so they can reprint all the tax forms and overnight it. But she's so pissed off at my lack of doing anything, you know. I told her "just go ahead and do the fucking tax forms yourself." She's like "when are you going to do them?" I'm like "you've got me running around the fucking state between trying to get work done, and trying to pick up your son, and trying to do this and trying to do that." I don't know when I'm going to fucking get it done. I've spent the last two days trying to figure out where I'm going to have an office.</p>

<p>[04:50.4]</p>

<p>She puts none of that into consideration. And literally the very next day after I spent an entire day moving and I'm just exhausted and making it convenient for her to finish her work, she's on me about the taxes. It's like "fine, you fucking do it. I'm done with it. You do it." We'll see how quickly it gets done because she's got a brief due today and she'll realize — and like I was telling my CPA, I said "you know, if I had to do this for a client, it would've been done months ago. You can't for myself." (pause)</p>

<p>[05:43.8]</p>

<p>It's like I really shouldn't give a shit about what this woman thinks about me. This has been the whole problem all along, is that her image of me is so distorted from the reality of what I am, who I do, what I believe, what I don't do, how I treat her. Telling me that I'm fucking authoritarian with the kid, you've got to be kidding me. Because I occasionally raise my voice to him? Because I grabbed him as he was walking away from me as I'm calling his name? She's living in some fucking la-la land. And there's nothing I can do about it. I can't argue with her. I can't say "no, you're wrong, I'm not authoritarian."</p>

<p>[06:37.3]</p>

<p>I basically have come down to every one of these little altercations with "stop lecturing me" and I walk away. "Stop lecturing me" and I hang up the phone. "Stop lecturing me." [And that's the way in the practice] (ph), I said "I don't need you lecturing me, stop lecturing me, I've got to coach practice." Because that's what she's doing. She's just lecturing me. I'm fucking fed up with it. She's all-concerned about the money when it affects her, but she's not concerned about the money when it affects me. I've just spent fucking more money than I had on getting rent. I'm going to owe money for the phone. I'm going to owe money for insurance. I still need to get a copper line from Verizon into — I didn't realize how difficult it is now to get a normal phone line installed. No one seems to know how to do that.</p>

<p>[07:38.8]</p>

<p>You say "I want to get some (inaudible at 00:07:41)." "Oh, you want Fios (ph)." I said "No, I want a fucking copper line, a simple phone line, the cheapest thing you've got." People look at me like I'm fucking crazy. I've got some crazy IP phone that's run over the Internet. I can take the phone off, plug it into any Internet anywhere in the world, and it'll ring when I get to my office. Or I'll call people like it's coming from my office which is all well and good, but I can't fucking fax over it. Because fax and voice over IP, the technologies don't connect. IP — everything is put into packets, broken up and put back together, and it just can't do that with a fax. So I need a fucking copper line.</p>

<p>[08:32.1]</p>

<p>The sales guy who is doing my regular phone and Internet is like "just Google Verizon reseller." And that's all I got was Fios (ph), Verizon Wireless, you know. Of course, I don't have a phone or Internet or anything to do on all of this, so it's like I just, that's one of the things I've got to do today. But today, I've got to pick fucking Ian up from school at 2:30, got to go right here to Pembroke, get my computer, still haven't unpacked, figure out what I can in the short time that I'm there, pick him up, entertain him for two or three hours, go to fucking soccer practice. Then our E&G chapter is having a little wine and cheese get-together which I feel like I should be at because I'm fucking president. I just feel like I should fucking be there.</p>

<p>[09:33.3]</p>

<p>So now I have to drive all the way in fucking 6:00 traffic, for this fucking wine and cheese thing, instead of spending the whole fucking day here. Every day has been like this. I picked him up on Wednesday, and I drove back up to Pembroke just to see what was going on with the phone guy. He's sitting there telling me that he can't do it. The next day, the guy is supposed to call between 9:00 and 10:00. The guy doesn't call me between 9:00 and 10:00. He walks in about quarter to 11:00 and I'm like "so, what's going on?" He's like "oh, your phone is ready to go." I'm like "oh, thanks." He went in and plugged it and reconfigured it and did some things. I got out of there just in time to get to E&G.</p>

<p>[10:30.2]</p>

<p>It's like I didn't go to Handball on Monday. I didn't go to Handball yesterday. I'm eating fucking fast food every meal. Talking to Jess, she's like "oh no, you should go to Handball." I'm like "You know, fuck you. Our fucking marriage broke up because you didn't want me going to fucking Handball, and now you're telling me to go to Handball. Like you know what's fucking good for me." I joke with people, when I tell Handball people that I'm separated they're like "oh, I'm sorry to hear that." I say "well, my wife thought I played too much Handball." And they smile and laugh. But it's really kind of true. I'm off having fun while she's at home on her hands and knees cleaning the dirt out of the grout. (pause)</p>

<p>[11:25.5]</p>

<p>I can't enjoy my walks with the dog. He just drives me fucking crazy. I'm gone all day long, and I come home and there's just fucking piss waiting for me at the bottom of the cage. I've got to clean all that out of there, you know. It's like I'm on this fucking loop of just insanity. Every day is just — I've got crazy people for clients, who I'm not getting paid, calling me every day. All I have is bad news for people. Everything is in bankruptcy. I've just got bad news for people. I don't have any good news for anybody. It's just fucking ridiculous. You know, I get good news, I find out on this closing that I had that I can do the title work and issue the title insurance and I was worried I wasn't going to make as much money as I should. But the fucking buyer co-signs on a lease or something with his daughter. The daughter says she pays the lease when she doesn't. So now he's got a judgment showing up on his fucking credit report.</p>

<p>[12:49.5]</p>

<p>We don't know if he's going to get the mortgage. So I can't even start working on it because I've got to order a survey. I've got to get a lien certificate. There's almost 200 bucks right there I've got to spend that I've got to wait until I make sure he gets a mortgage. I'm basically giving myself a week to get everything done before the closing. And I'm saying to myself, when he was pre-approved, who didn't fucking pull the credit? I mean, that's the whole pre-approval, pull the fucking credit and you'll see that there's a judgment. And you say to yourself, we've got to get this fixed before you start going shopping for a house.</p>

<p>[13:25.7]</p>

<p>Or at least call up your rep at the mortgage company and get it cleared. I mean, I'm like — I'm not saying I'm by any means perfect, but you know, everything in my life is broken. Nothing works like it's supposed to work. Nothing goes smoothly. Nothing. I try and post something funny on Facebook about this "Dogs Against Romney" because he put his dog on the roof of his car on a vacation back in the 80s. I've got this fucking idiot friend of mine who replies "well, ask your dog" because I said I know who — my dog has a Facebook page — and so I said "I know who Buddy (sp?) Buddy is not voting for." And my buddy from college who is constantly putting anti-Obama stuff on his Facebook page is like "well, ask your dog whether he'd rather be eaten or put on the roof because Obama, when he was a kid, ate dog in Indonesia."</p>

<p>[14:38.1]</p>

<p>And I'm like "Okay, I get it. So you're comparing the actions of a child in a third-world country to that of a grown man in the richest nation" and I put "excluding Portland" because he's from Portland. I mean, you've got to be fucking kidding me. I'm doing this as a fucking joke, and this is turning into some fucking partisan fight over who is worse about eating or putting a dog on their car. Like either one of them should be judged on those actions. You've got to be fucking kidding me. And then my friend Karl, who hates everybody politically, he chimes in. He goes "this is what discourse has come down to, they're both the same guy, this is Bush term number four." And it's like, I don't want politics on my Facebook page.</p>

<p>[15:28.3]</p>

<p>I'm just going to go back and I'm going to delete the whole thing. I'm going to delete all of the comments and say "I'm sorry. I'm removing political partisan stuff from my Facebook page. This is a joke. Either laugh at it, like it, but if you're going to comment and try to attack Obama or support Romney, either way, I'm going to delete it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You can't even make a joke.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And if my life had anything that was going right for it, I can't even be happy about the two or three closings that are rolling in, because they're going to be closing at the end of May/June. I need money today. I know my dad said he'd help me out with health insurance, but I'm probably going to have to ask him for money for health insurance.</p>

<p>[16:27.2]</p>

<p>That was one of the things that I needed my computer to do last night was to figure out how much Jess needs, can take from her money, and I could use to pay for health insurance and her phone. I feel like I'm in this hole that just gets deeper and deeper and deeper. It doesn't matter that business is starting to flow in. It's just not enough. It's just not enough. The simplest things set me off. I get pissed off. I get angry. I can't enjoy anything. I don't have fucking TV. My fucking radio doesn't work. I have to use my phone to listen to talk radio or NPR in the car, and that doesn't fucking work all the time. You know, there's nothing that just goes smoothly.</p>

<p>[17:25.4]</p>

<p>It's like today, I'm fucking running around like a fucking chicken with my head cut off and why? I shouldn't have to be fucking doing all of this. I shouldn't have to be fucking coaching the soccer team. I shouldn't have to worry about going to a fucking wine and cheese, but there's only 10 people in our group and if two people show up, it's going to look like crap. And the realtor is the one putting it on, so I'm really going because it's the realtor. I don't know. (pause) I can't get out of bed in the fucking morning. I didn't shave today. (pause) I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>[19:13.5]</p>

<p>Oh great. I thought — fuck. I keep meaning to fucking fax — well, I can't fax it anyway. On my kitchen table is the fax number and all of the stuff I need to get to the bank, and I fucking left it there. The dog — the landlord is telling me the dog cries all day long. He's been chewing into the metal. The metal is dented. There's like a big puddle of saliva outside of the cage, and he's literally fucking chewing the metal to get out of there. I seriously want to get rid of the fucking dog. He's not worth it. And this is coming from a dog person, you know? (pause)</p>

<p>[20:19.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know. Now there's nothing in your life that is making you feel good or making you feel any better. You're saying everything is a source of frustration.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and a lot of things are things that — I think part of the frustration are things that could make you feel good or should make you feel good, like the dog. You love dogs. You love Jack.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. All the fucking research out there, people live longer with dogs. People who walk their dogs are healthier, you know. And I'm fucking walking him around the block, and I just want to fucking put my foot halfway up his ass. And he senses that I'm tense, and it just makes it worse. He's walking like this and he'll stop and sniff and I'll pull him, and it's like fucking pulling a freight train. I'm just tired of it. I'm fucking worn out. I'm worn out.</p>

<p>[21:38.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you have to fight against every goddamn thing out there. [That's what happens.] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I'm not taking care of myself. I'm going and fucking eating at McDonald's and Burger King and I'm just eating shit. (pause) I don't know why. I know I'm not supposed to be doing it, you know. But I do it anyways. (pause) You know, it's not even about spending the money. I could go to Subway. There's better options.</p>

<p>[22:46.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe you want it or you're craving it or something, I guess, which is why you're doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the whole plan yesterday was to come home. The reason I didn't go back to the office — I was like I'm going to come home, make sure my bike is ready, ride my bike to Handball, play a little bit of Handball, bike home. (pause) It's like Monday. I want to ride my bike to Handball, but I've got this stupid fucking Union Square Main Streets thing. It's like every fucking night. Every day there's just something. I can't get a break from the world.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's pretty relentless.</p>

<p>[23:35.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's no one sitting there saying "atta boy." I'm being — Jess thinks I'm just sitting around fucking whacking off all day. She has no fucking clue what I do and how fucking stressful. No fucking clue. "Why haven't you done the tax thing yet?" We'll see how fucking quick she gets the taxes done because everything she is going to need, she's going to need from me. "I'm going to need this. I'm going to need that." With all the bank accounts, everything. (pause)</p>

<p>[24:43.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're right. Nobody is saying "atta boy." Nobody is really appreciating what it takes for you to keep fighting against all of this, or just to keep going.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, my mom calls me in the middle of — maybe it was on Tuesday — and I was just, I don't know what I said to her. But she called my dad all freaked out, all panicking, "oh my God." My dad, who has had surgery on his back, and is still — the doctor was so proud because it was one of the largest bulges or whatever he took out was one of his top ten list. He's still having pain, and so my dad wanted to wait until he had an MRI. I don't know what it was. But he calls me and I'm like "yeah, I'm just, you know" — I can't tell him what I'm telling you, you know. I mention the slightest thing to my mom, "oh, I wish I could help you." (pause)</p>

<p>[25:55.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get that you can't tell him this. What happens when you talk to him about what's really going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't. I just kind of beat around the bush with it. Just saying "oh, things suck."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it that he would get all freaked out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I just, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's not necessarily that he'd react badly. It just doesn't feel like the right thing to do or the comfortable thing to do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>[26:37.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying you feel ashamed of it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if that's what I'm saying. I'm just, you know (pause). There's so much that's going wrong that I can't put it all into one conversation. I'm having enough trouble communicating all of it to you within 45 minutes, you know, twice a week. (pause)</p>

<p>[27:26.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think — I guess I'm imagining that you probably — as much as you know a lot of it is not your fault or has to do with things you can't help or can't fix, I think you feel terribly responsible. And I imagine — I think you feel terribly ashamed. That's probably a lot of what makes it hard to tell your dad about it. There are probably other things too. There's so much of it, it's like where to start and all of that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's not how we communicate, you know. We communicate by making fun of each other or talking about sports. We just don't have that kind of relationship where — other than his physical ailments, we just don't talk about other stuff.</p>

<p>[28:26.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: My impression is that he wants to be there and wants to help you. Does it feel like this is stuff he sort of wouldn't get or wouldn't know what to do with?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I don't know. I mean, he was very — when he came up when I was in the hospital, you know, he was very understanding and whatnot. But it's just not the relationship we have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure it's not the relationship that you want. You don't want to be telling your dad all this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're going to be talking about something deeper with him or emotional, I'm sure this is not what you want it to be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have anyone I can talk to this stuff about. (pause) Now I'm worried that Jess is taking on doing this fucking IRS stuff that is not going to get done. She's not going to have time to do it. After 21 days, they send my fucking money to the IRS. (pause)</p>

<p>[29:53.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wait, sorry, what — who sends what money?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The money that they levied from my bank account. The bank holds it for 21 days, so if we can get in there and show that it's a hardship, they'll release the levy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, this is the hardship paperwork. I thought it was the —</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it's kind of the financial — the IRS reviews the financial situation. I don't know how long it's been, but it's already been a week or two. That money is gone. Jess wants nothing of trying to take responsibility for half of it. Half of that is her fucking tax liability. I can't get her to understand that. All I get is "you haven't given anything for the kids." "Well, you're going to get less chance of me giving anything for the kids now. Because when I have money, I'm not going to be able to spend it on the kids."</p>

<p>[31:02.7]</p>

<p>I'm in such a fucking hole. (pause) I mean, it's 1200 fucking dollars. Four months behind in rent. (pause)</p>

<p>[32:04.0]</p>

<p>I just don't know how I recover from that. In some ways, I don't even know how I get in that situation. My dad doesn't know about the tax levy. (pause) I'm trying to sell the tickets so I can get money for that. Hopefully those sell. (pause)</p>

<p>[33:15.7]</p>

<p>I just don't know how I get in this situation. (pause) To save myself the trouble of having to drive everything, make multiple trips down to Plymouth and bring all my shit to Plymouth, I spent $1,600 I don't have. Or, I do have, but it's rent money. (pause) I told my landlord I'd give him a check, and I never gave him a check because I just took $1,600 and pissed it away. (pause)</p>

<p>[34:10.4]</p>

<p>I owe $4,000 to my old landlord. [I'm out of there now.] (ph) At least I think. I'm just tired of fucking owing everybody. (pause)</p>

<p>[35:18.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think as much as you are so frustrated, so much of what is just sort of happening to you and being done to you or not happening for you, I think you also feel awfully responsible. I think you feel like you really fucked everything up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. (pause) I did fuck everything up. (pause) And I'm not getting an opening to —</p>

<p>[36:14.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Fix it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's just not there. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You didn't fuck everything up. You've fucked some things up and some things were fucked up for you.</p>

<p>[pause from 36:48.1 to 38:49.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just look around at all the people I know, and no one else seems to be having problems. So I feel completely alone. (pause)</p>

<p>[39:47.1]</p>

<p>I've fallen behind on my student loan payments, car insurance payments. (pause) I fucking owe everybody. I don't know. Two or three closings ain't going to make a difference for me. That's what I need to just break even. (pause) Fuck. (pause) I don't have letterhead or envelopes or anything to operate my business. I need to send stuff out for these fucking closings. I think I stupidly threw away envelopes and stuff. (pause)</p>

<p>[41:39.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're not that different from anybody else. You do have more problems right now than most of the people you're looking around at, I'm sure. But for what it's worth, you're no different from them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know what it is worth. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What makes you so different?</p>

<p>[42:18.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I'm fucking living alone. I'm miserable. Fucking nothing is going right for me. Even stuff that goes right just —</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Somehow gets fucked up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I've got to renew my license for issuing title insurance by the end of the month. I don't know if I get fined or what, but it costs more money so I've got to fucking do that. I've got a closing coming up for purthe bank. It's probably going to close next month or June. (pause) I can't even keep track of — just can't keep track of it all. (pause)</p>

<p>[44:23.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Where are you at as far as feeling suicidal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't think about it that much. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. (pause) Should I be thinking about it more? Are you encouraging me to think about it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No.</p>

<p>[45:17.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I just feel like it would fuck my kids over. That's the only reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can understand that. (pause) We should finish up for now.</p>

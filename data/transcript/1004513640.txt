<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm, I never would have guessed. Okay.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:00:06] to 00:00:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I always forget it's on there (chuckling). So I still don't have my car back.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, no.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. They ordered a part, the wrong part. Ordered the part, it kept shorting out. Eight hundred dollars later, there's a part that takes several days to get there, and I want to have the car back by Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's probably going to end up costing me like three grand.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ooohhh. And then you had had it down to, like, you know, eight grand, but they were going to do like a couple thousand bucks would, like, get it back on the road type thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought it'd be like 2,000. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I'd - well, probably more like 2500. Now this $800 part, maybe more like 3,000. I don't know. Hopefully.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know. I don't seem to be having any money coming in, and Jess's doing no work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She just has been doing other things so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a change, right? I mean she had been...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I'm not sure what the different reasons are, why she hasn't billed any hours this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But... And on a Thursday, Lucille, she couldn't put her down in the morning; she just would cry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which isn't it okay to just let her cry? (Chuckling)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Certainly a lot of people think so.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she wouldn't even come to me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She would go "Ahhhhhhh."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know. [00:02:07]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Make her "that's unacceptable" sounds. So that was one day. I think Wednesday was the half day. I'm supposed to have a closing this month and a closing at the end of the month. I hope so, 'cause the money I need for the tickets, but I've also got to be able to pay for everything else. So much for having money on me. I don't even think I'm going to have money for the vet bill, which is Thursday. I'm going to have to take that out of the business account and hope money comes in. I have at least one closing.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:03:16] to 00:03:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: The realtor and the E&G group referred a couple to me. [00:03:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's not going to close until May, so at least May I can have at least one thing. But Thursday the new guidelines are going into effect where it doesn't matter how underwater your house, though you just have to meet all the other qualifications; the credit and money, and they'll give you the loan, and that's Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. So that might actually see, you know, a number of people refinancing, so that would be helpful.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:06] to 00:04:12)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to catch a break sometime, somehow, right? Been a while, hmm? Oh, I don't know. [00:04:27]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm (tape clicking sound). So sorry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's all right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:04:36) that being cold.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:04:37] to 00:04:44)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not that cold in here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know it's not that cold in here. I understand it's cold (inaudible at 00:04:48).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Don't borrow my hat.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). Okay, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This isn't awkward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing).</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's really - I feel like, you know, the family's so poor that I can't afford the heat, or the heater's out and everybody's holed up in their coats. And, well, Jess's moving Lucille to a new daycare starting in April, an extra 300 bucks a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, you know, much improved over where she's at now. [00:05:37]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kids get out every day, outside every day, and, you know, there are multiple rooms.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this a daycare center?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Umm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a house. But so the woman, you know, uses multi rooms in the house for the daycare. So Jess thinks - and they probably were just confined to one room, the front room, and put little (ph) back in place and - yeah, caged animals. Give them a toy; they don't mind, right? [00:06:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what a lot of parents do. To clean the house, they just throw the kid in the back and play and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - throw some toys in there and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Go to the store. What possibly could happen? We have the pack and play. We only used it when it had like, you know, the bassinet part of it. When it came to actually using the actual pack and play part of it, Jess never used that. I don't know. I was never involved in these things so...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:06:58] to 00:07:23)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I took that housing core training yesterday. Not yesterday, Wednesday. And at first I was really anxious, because I'm like, "Oh, shit, now I'm going to have to go and actually do this thing. You know, it sounds pretty, you know..." We're all moving through, kind of -</p>

<p>[00:07:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - the courthouse and... Then they e-mailed me yesterday, you know, saying that, you know, they have an attorney. You can chat, I don't know, the first time. So I signed up for the first Wednesday of the month for four months; see if I like it. [00:08:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I imagine it will be a good experience, you know, just representing people in a mediation setting. Ultimately, whether it's going to make me money or not, I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:08:31] to 00:08:56)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Kind of bored today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hmm?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been bored today. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've been bored?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I should be doing my IRS paperwork, but... So I know I - modification; they keep on - this is the third time. That's what they call them, yesterday or the day before, trying to confirm where I lived. And I tried to explain to them that's not (ph) the temporary situation and that, for health reasons, I can't be around little - the family. But my family lives there so it's owner occupied. Then the first time it came up is because the wrong address was showing up in my credit report.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then they brought it up again the second time. And then this third time the guy wants to get verbal confirmation that I live at the Plymouth address, because that's what's on my credit report. And I'm like "You guys are so fucked up." You know, I'm being as sweet as -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - I can to them. So I figure, you know, they probably torch files where the people are assholes. [00:10:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I didn't get upset or argue with them or anything like that, so we'll see where that goes. Jess's going to be a real pain in the ass about that if we lose the house.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:10:33] to 00:10:43)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually home prices are one of the few places over the last year and five years that home prices are up in Plymouth, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it's because they take a dive so low, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:10:59] to 00:11:06)</p>

<p>CLIENT: On the condo they extended the inspection contingency ten days so you get a structural engineer in there to look at a beam or something like that, which is stupid. Claire has dealt with this home inspector before and knew he was a moron. [00:11:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's [inaudible] Inspection; they're one of the big companies, and they are, they all suck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, they hired people who work the cheapest, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they used their name to -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - get the home inspections. And buyers don't know this, you know. They're just "Oh, my God, there's a problem with this beam. I don't know if it's termites or..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that (ph). But his sister owns a unit in the building and would know that they're being very proactive about fixing things. It's just a pain in the ass. I'd kind of be happy if we killed the deal. [00:12:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Give me a few extra months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The interesting thing is that the referral from the realtor at the E&G group, she's not using the mortgage guy at the E&G group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's using the mortgage guy that everybody in her office uses, which could be a good introduction for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I told her, "Hey, why don't the three of us get together and have lunch?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so who knows? Maybe something will come out of that. I doubt it. He probably just uses, you know, whoever the realtor tells him to use. You know, I don't know if he does refi's or just focuses on this office or... You know, so you have a couple of realtor offices that you usually do almost exclusively, you know, you really don't need a whole lot of other business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:13:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I always run into that because they all have someone they use or someone in-house. There are some that there's a really diverse, you know - who they use for the mortgage. But, you know, if there's someone sitting there in the office, a lot of them use him. So I thought I'd have a good March because of the closings from the new guy, but that's probably not going to be until April so maybe I'll have a good April, but by then I might be fucked. I don't know. I have to go to the grocery store today. I've got peanut butter and that's about it. And only a couple of tablespoons left so... And I'd like an orange, maybe an orange, one or two oranges. [00:14:24]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, in that case...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all I really - today's an orange.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So... I've been doing that a lot, where I don't eat that much for breakfast or lunch and then eat a lot for dinner.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I still think to some degree of - well, my parents are here, so I ate a lot while they were here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I think even eating the amount of food that I eat at dinner, it's still fewer calories than I should be having, so I'm probably losing weight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, you... Ohhhh. Those people that had bought a condo that I thought was going to hire me to do collections hasn't sent me the retainer check yet. [00:15:20]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So kind of weird. And if I don't have it by Monday I'm going to e-mail them and say "What's up? You guys need help, or not?"</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was kind of hoping that they would send that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Plenty of work to bill upfront.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:15:45] to 00:16:04)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I have a loaner car. [00:16:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The dogs are trashing it; there's dog hair everywhere. It's a small dog. I don't know if I -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Don't know what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if I have some obligation to keep it clean or... They said just don't smoke in it, so I haven't smoked in it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The dog might have. I don't know. I don't know what he does when I'm not there, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). He hasn't asked for any help rolling any cigarettes or anything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Trouble with the lighter though, because he doesn't have a thumb.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he likes it because I left the car seats for the kids at the shop, and so he can lay and stretch out in the back, back seat, so he's been doing that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I brought in a sheet to cover up the front seat, and he tore it all down and balled it up into a little ball and there's spent (ph) dirt everywhere, you know, around it. So there's really not much I can do except probably get one of those lint rollers the day my car's ready.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:17:13] to 00:17:21)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So did you have a good time this morning?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was show-and-tell at school, career day?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling) That would be interesting, too, explain my career to a bunch of little kids.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Ian went and saw the talk doctor again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they played games. That's all he told me was that he won one time and she won one time, so I don't know what the fuck they're doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What possibly could you do to see him, you know, months apart, you know? [00:18:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:18:07] to 00:18:17)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Seems like my family's constantly, you know, either at a doctor's appointment, dentist appointment, just something, you know. The kid doesn't look right, take the kid to urgent care, you know. Just - I use the - just look at the kid and see how the kid's acting, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If the kid's acting normal, you know, they may have a cough, they may have a sore throat or whatever, but you know, they've got energy and they look fine, they're probably not sick, you know. If they look like hell, you know, then they're probably sick. I'm sure I'd mentioned when we were at urgent care for - see if Ian had strep throat. [00:19:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yes, you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And he's jumping all over me and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, Bouncing up the walls.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like, "This kid does not have strep."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I could stick my finger down his throat and culture it myself and tell you that he doesn't have strep. Lo and behold...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:31] to 00:19:39)</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was a Saturday, but it's stuff - that's why Jess can't get work done, because she can't just, you know, leave the kids somewhere, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:19:47) coming in. So...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:19:50] to 00:19:59)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't have the money for the rest of the lawyer's retainer, for the tax attorney. I'm supposed to go with him to the Bristol Rotary on Monday, so hopefully he'll give me a good kick in the pants about doing the paperwork.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I should do them tonight because Ian is not sleeping over tonight, he's sleeping over tomorrow night, but I'm just so unmotivated.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:20:32] to 00:20:37)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And (inaudible at 00:20:39) you're talking like - the image that keeps coming to my mind -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: - is like - you know, like the guy that does art, kind of like, "Water, water."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like crawling through the sand? Like clothes are kind of torn up and -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I have a little hole starting right there. [00:21:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: These jeans, they're pretty good. I got these at Target for like 12 bucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm going to have to go back to Target and get another pair of jeans.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey, that's like - that water is money but -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like -</p>

<p>CLIENT: There's no relief, you know. It's just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's no relief. Your focus is very singular. It's constant and overwhelming.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And everything I do affects it, you know? Like, you know, the constant reminder of E&G. There was ten people there yesterday, you know. I mean just horrible.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I guess part of the thing is that you pretty much feel this way all around, whether it's - when it comes to a bill you have to pay, or when it comes to, you know, E&G falling apart or to, you know, getting some kind of support from Jess or feeling like, you know, lots of things; like the feeling that everything is sort of dried up. [00:22:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. The car is done.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like I'm just throwing money away, like, as usual.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:22:45] to 00:22:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ahhhh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess I'm inclined to think that while, certainly, like, probably you'll not be able to pay your bills, and like, come here and wait in the hall and all that; contributes like - I guess I'm certainly inclined to think that's not the only thing going on. [00:23:14]</p>

<p>(Pause [00:23:14] to 00:23:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: What else is going on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I'm wondering about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's always on my mind, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's clear.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I do think about work. I go in there, but usually how I get out of bed in the morning is I start just panicking about work and I just can't take it anymore. Gotta pee. And it's like today, I had no reason to get up, and I was up at, like, 7:30. I'm falling asleep early, probably because I've just been eating so much food and just - I don't know. I tried to even have a little coffee last night before I went to bed, you know, when I got home. I just crashed, you know, like at 8:30. Just lay down on the couch and fall asleep. [00:24:16]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So there it is I think. I mean I haven't raised this in a while, but this is the thing that gets in the way of your being able to, like, take on some of the other stuff you wanted to take on. I mean like you get so singularly focused on how little you have or how much everything has dried up. It's hard to like get motivated to do stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To, like, follow through on things. [00:25:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, in one or other, that sort of pattern has been pretty consistent over the last couple of years, where you get so, like, overwhelmed and laid out by what you don't have and what that feels like that it's hard to kind of pick yourself up and do things you know you need to do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I have a bunch of, you know, meetings set up with people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And one, they cancelled, or Jess needs me during one of them, conflict with one of the Chamber events. But I'm trying to get involved with the Chamber and Rotary and, you know... I'm trying to be more active with my blog and on Facebook and just keeping in front of the people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm connected with, to remind them what I do. Yeah. And like I keep thinking that I have to type some masterpiece about something. Or today I just - there was a good - bankrate.com just had one of those slide things you put on, you know, of emotional mistakes that sellers make. So I just wrote a couple of sentences and said here's a card, go read it, and click here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if people actually do it, or they want to see that stuff or whatever, but, you know, reinforces in the back of their minds what I do. I don't know, maybe the 19th will be something special, like the home buying credit. [00:27:17]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another little mini refi boom would go such a long way for me, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's almost like I'm in the position to kind of take advantage of it, you know, and just to be able to, you know, put a little money away. But once I knew what my monthly payment was going to be for the taxes and, you know, what's going on... The mortgage, that's not me. I'm not part of that equation, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's all Jess's, not -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I could care less whether we keep the house or not, you know. [00:28:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I may just have to find a way to live - for me to live cheaper but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm. But you're not concerned about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But if I had, you know - just to have - it's unbelievable how little business I need to have a good month, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the depressing part.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's like I'm going back and I'm, like, making a bunch of old job - every closing is a job in QuickBooks. And going in, I'm just going in on the job screen, you know, and making all the old ones inactive so I can just keep a little more handle on what's open and what's, you know... Sort of getting myself ready for, you know, a busy time. And I mean it's like '04 and '05, I'd be doing 50, 60 closings. [00:29:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, some of them were active equity lines and -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, but it's just like, God, I did like 20 - what did I do? Twenty-five closings? I mean -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Totally different ballgame.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, in 2010 I must have done around 80 closings, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know? And then just have a shit year and then it just - it's got to pick up for me somehow. And on top of that is the buyer and seller reps that are a separate - you know, I don't use a numbering system for those files; I just use the people's names, where I assign a file number to all my closings.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I'm able to see now. And I used to start counting at a thousand, so my first closing would be 1001 04, for (inaudible at 00:30:00) in 2004 and '05. And it wasn't until like '07 that I changed over to having the year first and just keeping a running total, because that's what the computer does.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:30:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So right now I'm at, like, 12-1401. I've just done 401 closings since I bought the software.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, when the software was bought for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that was, like, '07. So the big problem why I felt I was not being successful in those days was just the big nut I was carrying, you know, all the debt and everything, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And now it's - you know, if I could have, you know, just five or six closings in one month, it would, you know, just -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - give me breathing room.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. You know, just a couple of - more consistent with the estate plans. You know, I can tell by the low number of title requests, that titles - title examination requests that I'm getting from the guy who's been sending me a lot of business, that things are slow. [00:31:30]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that like a bellwether, basically?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, for me. And, you know, he does - he's very successful. You know, he has a couple of people working for him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Paralegals, so he's a busy office. And he sent me three purchases - you know, this is including the refi's - but three purchase full titles for February, which I thought was a slow month. And then I just got one order for - you know, here we are first week in March, so anything that's coming afterwards is closing in April. [00:32:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So only one, one real closing for the - you know, it may not even be March, I don't know. He owed me some money. There's like $500 in old invoices that had been collected and I had to deal with them; that file dies off, the half of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So he said he was cutting me a check. I don't know if it was for the full amount or the 250 or whatever, and the half of it, you know. But so I can just - waiting for $100 to come along and (inaudible at 00:32:43) how pathetic it is, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jess gets a new client; gives her a check for $350 - he already owes her more than that - and postdates the check, tells her to deposit it early. This is earlier in this week, but it was dated for today. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I'm just like - you know, I know I'm going to deposit it on Monday and it's going to bounce probably, but, you know...</p>

<p>(Pause [00:33:09] to 00:33:16)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't seem to get someone who's like okay. You know, like, "We'll just pay you the money," you know? "Here's this big project I need you to do, here's my $5,000 retainer," you know? We've got this one woman who owes us $1500 who's sending $50 a month.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Jess's not even - if it's made out to Jess, so she's just putting that in her bank account, not even, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This another woman owes us $700 and we now accept credit cards. And I've been handwriting it on there, "We now accept credit cards now."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This other woman owes like, I don't know, $1300, you know, and makes $100,000 a year. I mean Jess knows how much they make because she has to do their financials for the divorce.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, right. [00:34:02]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the woman is complaining how she has no money and can't pay us. You know, it's like 1300 bucks. Put it on your fuckin' credit card. I mean she hasn't paid us in three months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's like we're a charity. We're welfare, people who need to be on welfare, but we're a charity, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both sides.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, people want us to work for free, but no one wants to go into this, you know, with any idea... Here I'm saying this after I just had, you know, over $10,000 dropped in my lap and I'm still fuckin' broke, you know? That's how miserable it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, it really is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It blows me away when I think about that. You know, it's like, fuck. I mean, you know, three grand of that's going to the car, 2800 was for rent; there's another three grand. That's over half of it right there. Pats tickets, $2375, you know. That leaves very little room for anything else. And I didn't think my car was going to be that much money, so I started spending - paying parking tickets. I spent, you know, 250 - I've spent over $300 just paying off parking tickets, you know, $400 if we include my (inaudible at 00:35:39). So here I am thinking I've got money to spend and I don't, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And those are checks I can't bring back; I've already mailed them, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:35:52] to 00:35:58)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you're here to take care of stuff when it feels like you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:36:00] to 00:36:15)</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, it's like I'm going to work my ass off doing this Accountant-for-the-Day program, you know, and I'm offering pro bono services, you know.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:36:25] to 00:36:35)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. It's supposed to be for free, but I think I'm being suckered.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Chuckling). Pro bono is Latin for sucker?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean there's a chance these people could hire you to go in front of the judge because you've just - working on their case in front of the mediator, the housing specialist, and they can hire you on a limited assistance arrangement to go in front of the judge. But, you know, that came back on that, you know. I mean if I like it or if I find it's very valuable and it's not too stressful for me, I'll do more than the four. [00:37:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because it's good just to get to know the other lawyers, (inaudible at 00:37:27), the housing court staff and, you know... I kind of shy away when those phone calls come in, but now I can go, "Oh, yeah, okay," you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>(Pause [00:37:38] to 00:37:50)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Blowing air through lips sound)</p>

<p>(Pause [00:37:51] to 00:38:31)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Probably if it wasn't for coffee I wouldn't even be able to move forward at all, you know. But making coffee at home... Today - yesterday I bought a coffee and today I bought a coffee. I bought McDonald's last night for dinner, too, because I knew I had no food and I was -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - stressed out about the car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I might go to the grocery store afterwards and go buy my salads and my broccoli.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Very healthy stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Apples and oranges and bananas and soy milk. [00:39:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Some hotdogs for Ian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Rock on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Brought the bike upstairs; now if I could just put it on the damn trainer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And if I could get on it and start riding it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, doing some exercise.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I'm not - the bike -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it. It's not - hasn't happened, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's leaned up - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I got it. But you're thinking about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've been thinking about it for a long time, but now I'm getting to the point of I've got to get in shape.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. You've got Handball starting up, probably.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Excuse me, disc. Sorry, I apologize.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, actually it's funny because Handball, Wham-O -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The original Handball flies differently than whatever disc we use.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like the original Wham-O Handball.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's why it's called disc is because we use a plain disc made by Discraft; that's not a Handball. A Handball is something -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the difference? Is it the weight or the shape? [00:40:11]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The weight, yeah, and the shape.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the weight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know, but 175 grams is what we play with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a pretty heavy disc.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, uh, Handball now makes a disc, which they call the Handball Disc, which is approved by the UPA.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The governing body of ultimate -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's kind of funny when I saw one of those in the toy store. I'm like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, a lot of Handballs are lighter. They might be 150 or 160 grams, which would be different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they're -</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It'd fly totally differently.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: People who think I - I tell them that, and they laughed at me and they go, "Buggy."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. I actually -</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's like my throws were so much better when we used to play right on the water because there was so much wind that I had to have crisper throws. [00:41:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, because I don't work on my throws that much anymore. And who knows how my shoulder is going to be. I want to do some yoga to strengthen my upper body so I don't have the same problems I had last year. All wonderful dreams, you know. All this time I'm not making money, you know. Instead, I'm playing poker with people all around the world. And the only reason I'm doing more social networking for the firm is because I'm, you know - nothing else to do, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, and there's this big networking event. There's a guy with - all I think he does is puts together these big networking events. And I really wanted to go to one, but it's on a day I've got to - I think maybe an appointment here. I'm going to have some conflict with their - which kind of sucks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it's okay with me. I'm happy to look at rescheduling.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. What day of the week is the 23rd?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is that a Friday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe we should reschedule that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. We should stop for now. Can we do it on Tuesday? It's still a couple of weeks out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: All right. Ahhh... Going now to the grocery store in the $40 range (inaudible at 00:42:35).</p>

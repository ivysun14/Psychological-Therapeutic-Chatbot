<p>CLIENT: This pillow is a lot more comfortable than it looks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, say that again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh just this pillow is much more comfortable than it looks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay. Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I feel like when I have been doing pretty well for 24 hours or so I - like then I feel my sessions don't go as well.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know quite why. The current theory is that when I'm having a good day I don't want to think about the things that make me not have a good day. I tend to be fairly kind of - I don't know - evasive; focused on the present, trying to kind of get things done. Today is a day of trying to get things done. I have a job interview today. [00:01:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh congratulations.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah for part-time research assistant. I'm probably not going to get it because it's in the professors in contemporary art, and I have absolutely no background in that. So if he has one person who wants to work for him who has any background, he's probably not going to pick me. All I can say is well I learn things pretty fast and pretty much any topic you throw at me I'm going to get pretty excited about. (inaudible at 00:02:06). So I'm (pause) anyhow planning how it will go in my mind at which, of course, it will not go at all like that. You know having imaginary conversations that I expect to happen in the next few days or the conversations that have already happened but I kind of wished went differently. (Pause) I did a lot of playwriting in college and... [00:02:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:02:56).</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. I like having conversations. (Pause) Yeah, this is still a little scary. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm more comfortable with a clearer role from (inaudible at 00:03:44). Although I mean when I was in the hospital both times what pissed me off more than anything were types of nurses, especially the people who worked there, who made this very clear I am in the role of care giver and you are in the role of sick person. And were very clear about what they wanted me to be. That they expected me to - I don't know - be sick in some specific way. Or not so much that they expected me to be doing anything active but that they expected me not to be capable in some way. I just got tired of people taking a side and saying pour out your troubles to me and I'll fix them. [00:04:55]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or talking to me like I was an idiot. But I talked to... I mean after a couple of instances of what I thought was extraordinarily condescending behavior I talked to other patients and they did not seem bothered by it like they didn't seem to notice. So maybe it was just me. (Pause) I don't know maybe I'm just more either used to being the expert or used to being around people who consider themselves an expert and I pay attention to. [00:06:12]</p>

<p>(Pause) The funny thing is I have this implicit trust in authority that drives James insane. I mean I don't know that it actually bothers him that much, but it definitely is not the way he works. And I think it took him... For a while I think he respected me less because of it. He respected me less because it didn't occur to me to challenge; to ask for proof every time an expert told me something. We used to fight about that a lot actually. If there was a fight that could've broken us up it was that and he didn't respect my work. He didn't respect the way I was doing it. [00:07:16]</p>

<p>I mean that took us years to figure out kind of right up until we got married. I mean we were starting the drive from Kansas to Texas to get married and the first night we had just this huge fight in the car while we were driving. I at one point said something like I don't give a shit whether you don't think my work is valuable, but if you don't just back off, fuck you, and let me do it like let me get on with it. (Laughter) I don't think I ever said fuck you to James before. Maybe once or twice but it's very rare. [00:08:21]</p>

<p>And the way we worked it out it was like we had the same fight over, and over, and over, and over, and never got farther with it. It was like we both knew we needed to fix it, and we couldn't figure out how to move past it, and it would just keep coming up where I would say oh this is this awesome thing that I found out today. And he would say, "How do you know it's true?" And I would say, "Well the professor told me it's in this book." And he'd say, "That's not good enough." And I would say, "Well there's this piece of evidence, and this piece of evidence, and this piece of evidence." And he would just be like that's not good enough. And then I'd be like you think I'm an idiot. If you don't think that I have the capacity to reason on my own why are you with me? [00:09:19]</p>

<p>(Pause) What eventually worked it out, I think, was him understanding that I realize that I'm in a field that has a lot of people that have pretty shitty methodology and that I don't take what they say for granted, but that I think that is worthwhile regardless. I mean I think... Yeah, he's just not... That's not a very good way of explaining it, but it was kind of a gradual change in him that he just kind of had to become more comfortable with dealing with situations in which absolute proof wasn't possible. And that's the sea in which I swim like I'm so comfortable there. (Pause) And yeah... That he had to learn that I recognized the difference between evidence that's conclusive and evidence that points in a direction where you say well this is the most likely thing but we don't know, and I think that's still worth doing. [00:11:05]</p>

<p>And then he had to tell me several more times that he did actually think that I was smart (laughter) by way of apology. Yeah. (Pause) James is not... Our earliest one was... James has not very many people who are as smart as he is, and I think that's really to his detriment. In some ways I am not at all as intelligent as he is. In some ways I'm much more - At some things I'm much better at. I actually care much less about than he does and I find it one of his less appealing qualities. We had a fight about that too actually more recently. We just watched the Facebook movie. Have you seen that? [00:12:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And at the end of it James was like I don't think that guy's any smarter than I am. And I'm like why the fuck do you care? (Laughter) Why do you always - it's like measuring penis sizes like why is this important to you? And that's when I think he kind of recognized my criticism but still it's important to him. And I just don't think that intelligence is - you know it's one variable among many, but for him it's the variable. [00:13:14]</p>

<p>So I wish you were not at the University of Ohio. I wish you were in biomechanics. He just - because I've met all of his colleagues and yeah they're not that smart. It is true they're nice people, and good people, and do good work, but they're not - his advisor is brilliant. The people who have tenure are brilliant; some of them. Some of them are just good at what they do. But he just doesn't have enough time. It's just bad for him. It makes him depressed because he doesn't have anybody to talk to and it makes him arrogant. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>(Pause) I like having somebody to lead me. I gravitate to that. I'm a good second in command. So we work well together.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sometimes I think what's more difficult for you is it seems like your competence isn't recognized.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. Yes. When I feel like he's calling that into question, I get really pissed off. And partly because it's such a dramatic reversal of the ways that he typically values me. And in part because... I don't know. I have this impulse to be easily cowed that he knows is kind of one of those things that got trained into me of if somebody says no you're wrong I say well okay I'm probably wrong unless I know I'm right, and then I dig my heels in, and I don't go anywhere. [00:15:46]</p>

<p>(Pause) Yeah. And I was talking with Heather Kate about she's having problems with her husband who is wonderful and not terribly observant, and (pause) it's one of those things that gets sucked into a gender stereotype so easily. I never actually saw this movie thank God. There's a movie with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a while back on the ads for it she's like I want you want to do the dishes. And he's like oh right. Basically she needs him to take more active care of her and tell her that she's pretty, and be nice to her, be loving toward her in active ways, and he just doesn't. It's like but I love you. Why should I have to act like it. [00:17:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He still doesn't get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's like but if I have to constantly tell you what I need then... But she was talking about how much she is very forthright, very confident, says what she means from everybody except for Diego. And that when Diego disagrees with her she says okay we'll do that. She caves immediately, always. (Pause) I don't know. [00:18:03]</p>

<p>I have a tendency to think that my friends and I are the same person. (Laughter) And with Heather I feel like there's maybe a little more justification than most because we were best friends in high school. We were very, very close. The joke was well I know I'm not a lesbian because if I were I would be married to you. And I'm pretty sure we were both perfectly sincere about that. (Laughter) And yeah we had very similar patterns, and I tend to do that with James to some extent; less than Heather Kate and Diego like a lot less in part because James is way more observant than Diego is. And in part because we've spent most of the years that we've been together working on the dynamics of how we work like that. Like picking apart, and talking about it, and me saying I feel like I can't say no when you want something, or when you disagree with me I immediately change my mind. [00:19:31]</p>

<p>(Pause) But if James actually decided that I wasn't very smart I'm pretty sure I would believe him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're pretty sure...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would believe him. (Pause) Have you read "Flowers for Algernon"?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No. [00:20:14]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think there's a movie about it, but I only read the book. I read it. It's about a man who's mentally retarded who volunteers for an experiment that makes him kind of super human intelligence. Like he grows to the point where he has surpassed all of the scientists who performed the study that made him intelligent and finds that there are errors in the procedure that are going to lead to this process being reversed. And it's told in diary forms and it follows him going from this barely literate, barely functioning adult to this amazingly intelligent man and back down again. And it was a really good book for me to read when I did it and it's like probably in seventh or eighth grade. [00:21:29]</p>

<p>Because I was just starting to realize that I was smarter than most people. And it stuck with me because the point of the book is that intelligence does not make you a good person. It is not a virtue. It's just a tool. (Pause) So you know it keeps me humble. [00:22:19]</p>

<p>(Pause) Then I come someplace like the university here where everybody is convinced that it's a virtue. And how big is your penis? I don't know. (Pause) I'm trying not to buy into that. It's hard for me to remember that if I don't get this degree I will still be the same person. My life will not be wasted. And that it's okay if I decide I don't want that, or if I decide I don't want to work that hard. (Pause) Just so you know those are a few of the things I tell myself today (inaudible at 00:23:40).</p>

<p>(Pause) The thing is I was so... So going back to the Facebook movie it was "The Social Network". I keep forgetting the name. I got very upset actually as soon as the movie was over. James was like I don't think that guy - I'm as smart as that guy is. It was like the whole point of the movie isn't that. (Laughter) Is that line of reasoning... [00:24:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He doesn't necessarily get you what you actually really wanted in the first place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you really wanted in the first place.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) You know that this girl breaks up with him in the first scene of the movie because he thinks he's too smart for her, and she's like you're an asshole. Oh my God. [00:25:06]</p>

<p>(Pause) It is a little daunting though to be on a job market and realize that I got nothing. The last place I applied I heard about the job through a friend who works there and she wrote me back and she was like just so you know that HR person usually doesn't hire people with master's degrees; like she won't hire them because they don't stay typically.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's like well fuck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Didn't think that would count against you. [00:26:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah. I don't know. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal to be really poor for ten years, but it's a bigger deal than I thought it would be. I mean not big that I particularly mind being poor but because - I don't know - when I was 22 it didn't occur to me that I would come down with two life threatening medical conditions for years (laughter) and have... It didn't occur to me that I might be committing myself to a career path where I have to wait ten years to have a kid and maybe not even then. And everyone will respect me less for having children. It really didn't occur to me because I suck at money and had no financial training whatsoever. Actually it's a good idea to start saving for retirement when you're still in your 20's. I just thought oh life will be fine. [00:27:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. (Pause) You don't seem too daunted by the couch.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, less so. I do find it easier to talk.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Now that you've brought it up I'm like well is this seat for Chad? I don't know. Am I doing this right? (Laughter) Oh...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The good thing it's clear who this is for at least. [00:28:33]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Laughter) Also it's going to be awkward when I start crying because then it was like everything's bringing us back down.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh no. Now I'm feeling (inaudible at 00:29:04)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No, this is helpful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's very different because you are talking less and (pause) I don't like that. [00:29:38]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's not something I'm doing really intentionally or might not be so usual.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You sound different and I'm trying to get a sense of that. I'm trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. I think that's partially a change in venue. Partially I'm not coming in today with here's today crisis fix it please. Yeah, so that's good. [00:30:25]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yesterday you said or you asked so I don't think that I will get better. And so I guess what I've been thinking about for a few days, a week, is that there's always two sides to a statement like that. You know I'm always saying I have no options and the other side of that is please tell me more options. I don't think I will get better and the other side is please let me get better. [00:31:23]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Pause) I found out there's probably not actually a causal connection here but I feel as though the more openly optimistic I am about something the more crushing it becomes when it doesn't work. Maybe this is the other side of optimism. Optimism expresses the opposite.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know that that's actually true in that I really do most of the time just not... But it's like there's always these unsolvable problems that somehow get solved, but I don't understand how. [00:32:52]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well (pause) you know like my senior year my second semester I had six English term papers to write in 12 days. And it's like how the fuck am I going to do that and I did it. It happened. It just did. It happened. (Pause) And with the depression before this I've always gotten better but there's no clear causal link. I don't know why I get better. I don't know how. [00:33:45]</p>

<p>You know part of it is seeing situations you know putting myself in a different place but that's not all of it. And those situations don't always help. So it seems like this time it's here to stay, but it could also just lift at any point for no apparent reason and go away. But it seems less likely this time. And then there's also the problem that if I have two good days in a row I think I'm cured. And I don't know. Maybe having a terrible memory is a survival trait. (Laughter) [00:34:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like each part is sort of slide off from the other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The well part of the not well part?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I feel like different people. I can't remember what it is... It's very difficult to remember what it is like to not be well when I am well. And usually I remember it by describing it to myself or somebody else and then by the end of the description I'm not well. Yeah. (Pause) I'm not wanting to think very hard. Oh my gosh, what to do? [00:36:01]</p>

<p>(inaudible at 00:36:14) yesterday. Yeah at the end of the day when it's been a good I've kind of fallen asleep hard it's very, very unsettling. It's like I'm trying to run and check say like is this real. Where did this come from? Is this going to last? Am I just not listening to myself enough? Yeah, I can't just go to sleep. I can if I'm tired enough but... [00:37:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it possibly you're also sort of warier of being lower here today knowing you'll be gone next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hadn't thought of that. I am a little anxious about being gone next week. I don't know that that would make me warier of being low here today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. No I actually left yesterday's session I felt good. I felt better. Afterwards I was like wow that never happens. (Laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know what's going on with that. [00:38:13]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. Yeah, I don't know how this week's going to go. I haven't thought much about it actually, or I haven't done much at all. I keep telling myself to be okay with the fact that James is really the one who's putting this together and keep not being entirely successful. (Pause) We're both on the same page again. We basically just want to do things that are easy. Go for a walk, sit and read, hang out. [00:39:27]</p>

<p>My mother once told me about her honeymoon with my father and how disappointed she was that they just went camping by a lake, and she read, and he fished, and that was the week. (Laughter) It sounds like that's all I want to do. That sounds perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But... I don't know. (Pause) But when James and I are together (pause) I think we're closer than my parents ever were. I mean I'm fairly certain of that. But... [00:40:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well we can stop for now, but have a wonderful week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Thanks you too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you. [00:41:15]</p>

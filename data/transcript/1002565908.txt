<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So what's the story?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I feel good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really do.  I feel good.  I think the last time that I had the whole, um, reaction there was a culmination of a lot of things going on, just outside forces.  Um, with, uh, the money thing, money and, um, the kids were just starting school or it's just right before school and there was that whole issue.  And it was right before my period, excuse me, and, uh, I usually get a little crazy right before my period anyway.  You know, just, you know, snappy.  And, uh, and this time right before my, I didn't have that.  I didn't have it at all.  I don't know what if maybe I was drinking too much coffee, because I'm an avid coffee drinker, it's hard to like cut down.  But I've cut down my consumption to like one cup a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fine.  As long as I don't drink over a cup.  If I drink over a cup I get like, you know, shaky, so squirrelly like, you know.  So I don't, um, do that.  Um, and I've been meditating.  I have always been drawn to the metaphysical side of life and, um, now that I'm taking the lithium I feel like my emotions are stable enough that I can really pursue it as far as like meditate, you know, trying to do meditation that kind of stuff.  So I've been doing that only for maybe about 2 weeks, you know, and only for a short period of time, um, like 15 minutes I give myself, you know.  And I guess that's a lot for a stay home mom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So were you trained in TM?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, I kind of self taught.  I have a ton of books.  Ton of books on it.  Um, and I've seen like great results from it.  I've definitely become, um, more intuitive, you know.  I've definitely been able to ground myself in situations where I needed to ground myself.  And it work, you know.  So I think, um, another huge breakthrough for me was I was able to, um, really honestly forgive my parents, to see that they're just like me, they're going to make mistakes and that they did the best that they could in their faculties, which for the longest time I was so bitter and so hateful towards them and carried so much hate in me, but I did it for me.  I didn't do it for them, I did it for myself so I could, you know, remove that from myself and I can move on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it was a huge breakthrough for me to be able to do that.  And so far it really, whenever I think of them, I feel more pity, you know, than hate.  I don't feel, I really don't feel hate.  I feel, you know, kind of bewildered and sorry for them, you know, and I try to send them positive, you know, because they are my parents, you know, they are my parents and hopefully maybe someday they'll get it right, but I feel like we're all on the same kind of road and have a lesson to learn and, you know, each of us are going about it in a different way and some of us will reach that, you know, lesson and.  One of the teachings is if you can see the lesson in what you've been through, then you will have truly reached a higher plane, when you can actually say I understand the lesson and thank you.  And then you move on.  You know, and I feel that I was able to do that.  But honestly I would not have been able to do that without taking lithium because I was so chemically imbalanced that I could not, you know, I tried doing it when I was, you know, manic depress, you know, before I had the medication and I could take it only so far and then I just wouldn't be able to do it.  I would go off on a, you know, on one of my, but now I feel like I'm able to really go forward in it and it's a very, I feel it's a very positive thing for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, it sounds awesome.  Actually, um, what had happened was we went from 600 to 900 and you got a lot of tremor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, yeah, really shaky.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I was thinking about it and I was thinking, well, what could we do?  There is such a thing as 750.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There is such a thing as different formulations of the medicine that might, you know, achieve a slightly higher level or suit you better.  Um, so now we're going to do nothing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't feel that I need it.  I really don't.  I don't, you know, I really don't understand why that, unless it was just a culmination of everything altogether, you know, and just stress kind of, I don't know if that can destabilize you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you didn't really say that you were elevated; you said more that you were irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  I definitely wasn't having any like, um, I want to go out and buy a bunch of stuff kind of thing or I want to go out and have an affair kind of thoughts.  It wasn't that.  It was just like I was really like, you know, on edge and just didn't like the way that I felt because I couldn't shake it for a couple of days and I'm like, oh, you know, and for me I'll always unfortunately, you know, jump the gun and be like uhh.  I think I'm still, I think I'm still learning.  Like I was telling you on the phone to who I am, you know.  Sometimes I'm like, well, is that a normal response, would that be a normal response for a normal [PATIENT NAME] or would that be, you know, an unusual response if I was unmedicated.  So I'm still kind of, you know, trying to find my middle ground.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's a little, you know, sometimes it's frustrating because I don't understand really.  I have nothing to base it on, really because I've lived the other way for so long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a big address thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is, it's huge.  See I try to explain that to my husband, I said you have to be patient with me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, but I think you're doing extremely well because you're so motivated.  A lot of people really fight the difference.  They're so used to the intensity and the drama and the excitement.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, I'm tired of drama.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That they fight, uh, the more evenness.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Like I remember reading a bunch of books about them, people saying I feel like soda with no fizz.  You know?  Or I feel dull.  I don't feel dull.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't feel dull.  I feel calm.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't feel paranoid anymore.  I don't feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin anymore.  That was not a pleasant way to be.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	At all.  And I realize that inside of me but I just couldn't control it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, your euphoric highs were switching to more irritable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I wasn't having anymore euphoria.  I was definitely more paranoid and, you know, anxious and irritable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, we're, we're not going to mess with this.  Um, we talked about other things.  We talked about the debt counseling, and stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any, anything happening with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, um, we're doing okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Believe it or not.  I mean, I don't know, it just sometimes, sometimes things work out for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I, we're, you know, I got this book, it was called America's Cheapest Family, gets you right on the money.  The name of the family is the [NAME OTHER].  They're Greek and I just think the last name's hysterical because they're real penny pinchers and I've taken like our budget with our, you find a lot of money, like play with money as far as your food budget.  Like I couldn't, we were spending like $800, over $800 on food, on groceries.  Now mind you, that's not even when we go out to eat and spend the money.  So I, you know, I added it up, I went through my debit, and I'm like, Jesus, you know, I've got to do something here.  So far I've cut it down to $500.  So and then we don't eat out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We eat at home.  What I buy is what we eat.  And people have to learn to eat it.  We're not allowing, you know, people saying, well, I'm not going to eat that, you know, which is my second daughter, you know.  So I have the menu.  I go 2 weeks out, 14 days, prepare a menu and then go buy that menu and everything that coincides with it.  The only thing that we have to buy is milk, like they froze their milk.  They'd pour it off and freeze it and [NAME OTHER] is like that's ridiculous.  He goes, we don't have to go that crazy about it, just allow for it in the budget for that 2 weeks, you know, and then we'll just go get it as we need it because, you know, my little guy still drinks a lot of milk and everybody in the family drinks a lot of milk.  But, uh, about 3 gallons a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Should buy a cow.  Should move to Vermont.  I wish.  But, uh, so I've been able to do, you know, the budget that way and free up, you know, $300, which we apply to bills, you know, apply to credit card bills or whatever, you know, it's already spoken for as far as we're concerned.  And my husband's been getting a lot of overtime for, I mean, he's had overtime before all this, even when we were in that state, but it seems to be steady, what he does, he works every single Saturday and he does like his side jobs.  He doesn't work as much though.  I told him, I said, this is too much on you and us emotionally and you physically and emotionally.  So he does, he picks and chooses what he's going to do and he'll maybe work 2 or 3 maybe times a week.  He doesn't work as much if he's working like, you know, 6 days a week and it was just ridiculous.  So we're trying to like moderate our lifestyle.  And eventually live below our means so we have money freed up, you know.  It's learning because my parents were never good money managers at all, you know.  They ran from the IRS you know, it's like when the bill collectors would call I'd be the one answering the phone, so I never got a lesson in how to manage your money properly.  So it's kind of like I'm learning, you know, along the way how to be responsible with money and it's weird because I look at our credit card bill from what I did when I was manic and it's like looking at something somebody else did, like another person, and being like what were you, what is wrong with you, you know, and I still have stuff in my closet that has tags on it.  I don't think I can take it back because it was a long time ago, but it's been hanging there forever.  And I'm thinking we need to have a garage sale to get rid of some of this stuff or give it to a consignment store.  But you know, it's just I look at it and I'm like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not stuff that you're wearing?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  Like I have this one, like, number one I can't fit in it now because I gained so much weight, size 4 dress, you know, a velvet like, where the hell am I going to wear that with, I mean, I look at my life and I'm like where am I going, to like some debutante ball.  I'm like, you know, wear that to McDonald's or—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's been how long ago?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Two years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.  Too long to return it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a nice dress.  It's a good party dress, but I'll never wear it.  I'm never going to wear it, you know.  I tell myself that I will but I'm never going to wear that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, when you have some time you might figure out how to, there's always eBay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, or Craig's List.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Craig's List.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Which is like the poor man's eBay.  But, um, I just look at the stuff and I'm like oh my god, I have all these like designer purses and I'm just, and like I wear, I bring a wallet with me now, that's what I, I actually gave my daughter my [INAUDIBLE], I'm just like here take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe if you're not going to use it you should recoup whatever you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm trying.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Why not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know.  I just feel guilty.  Just guilt associated with it but then I try to myself that you were not in control.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Emotionally it's easier to not look at it than to deal with it, but I think it would be in terms of who you're describing, it will be positive, you're accepting that that wasn't under your control and it's done.  So whatever you can recoup is, it would be positive, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A friend who would enjoy it or if you can get something for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm going to try.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, be a little project.  Part time job.  All right, so we are not going to change the lithium, continue to see [NAME OTHER], right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, well, actually I haven't seen her in a while.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like a month.  Um, it started out with my mother and my father in law had something come up and I couldn't see her for a couple weeks and then school started.  And then I just kind of got out of the habit of seeing her, but once again I feel like seeing her got me to a certain point.  It got me to come to you and get on the medication.  I feel like she was a facilitator for me to get where I need to go but I don't feel so much that I need her right now because a lot of the reason why I went to her has been taken care of.  With the taking the medication but I also feel like the thing with my parents that was another reason and the things that have happened in my past.  On top of the fact that I forgave my parents, I forgave the guy that molested me when I was [AGE], like I knew, he's a troubled soul.  And that's what he knew, and that's what he did.  And I wrote down the things that I learned from it.  That was the most important thing.  If I've gotten a lesson from it, then what have I learned?  And it's just to be more aware of my children and to watch them and to be open to them coming to me, you know, and letting them know that it's okay to come to me and tell me, you know, because my parents never did that.  So that's a lesson I learned from that.  You know, I try to turn it around and make it positive.  So I don't feel that I need her so much to do that for me.  I think that I have the strength in me that I can do it, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That it's always been there, but now I really believe that taking the lithium has allowed, you know, myself, I guess somewhat to calm down, to have that calm surface where I can do that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're doing a lot.  You're doing a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I want to.  I really want to take this as far as I can as far as, you know, because I believe that I'm a very, I've always been a very spiritual person.  So I believe that I can go very far with it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, and the [INAUDIBLE], what's happened with that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I finished my last in a group of 3 shots, and it's okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not hallelujah, I'm healed, you know, but it's not oh my god, I can't walk, you know.  It's kind of somewhere in between.  I have good days, I have bad days.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, um, she said that, you know, in 6 months if it's hurting me really bad again I can get another.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Another series.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, or she said you can just do 1, you know, and see if that helps you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who do you go to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, her name is, uh, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I, we've, yeah, I've heard of her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's a very nice lady.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Really, really great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She is, uh, affiliated, um, with [DEIDENTIFIED] in the [DEIDENTIFIED] branch.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, she's off of [DEIDENTIFIED], I think it's [DEIDENTIFIED].  She's in the like the whole medical arts building but it's actually attached to the hospital.  So she's over there.  That's her office.  I think she's on the 3rd floor.  But she's a really nice lady.  I really—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a role for some kind of maintenance, you know, like swimming or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She told me to go to physical therapy.  She told me I'm just a, it's getting there.  It's getting into physical therapy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, I think if they could teach you the right exercises, the right, you know, what to do good and what to do bad and what not to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, uh, it'd be helpful [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she was adamant.  She was like you need to go to physical therapy.  She's like if you don't, you're going to be in pain again.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I've just got to get off my butt and just physically go.  That's the thing it's just getting there, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I think it's to an extent that, you know, my mother and father in law are the only people to watch my children, period.  There's no one else that watches my kids and I wouldn't have it any other way.  But in a way I feel like, you know, they're getting up there.  My father in law, he's like [AGE], he can kick my butt, but, you know, to have, to bring my kids over there all the time it's, you know, I kind of feel bad, but I think they would be hurt if I took them to someone else, you know.  It's that kind of dynamic.  I don't want them to feel that I feel I can just drop him off whenever, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I know they're not like that, it's just that's an excuse.  I'm just being lazy.  It's a lot of work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but it would be good to have a program that you would eventually do on your own just to keep you out of trouble.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, strengthen your stomach and your legs.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, that's essentially it.  Um, I was in great shape a couple years before I had [NAME OTHER].  Um, I was working out all the time, but I was also very manic, you know, it seemed like the skinnier I got the more manic I got before I was on medication.  And the more I gained weight, the more it was weird, it was like a phase.  Like I'd go through a phase where I was like, you know, 130 pounds and then I'd go through a phase where I'm like almost 150 pounds, you know, and it was like back and forth, back and forth.  But I feel like I've leveled off now.  I'm like 152.  But I don't feel like a desire to eat any more, like, you know, or be more, actually now I feel like I've normaled out and I can probably drop about 5 and I'd be fine with that, you know, because I'm tall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm lucky I guess that I'm tall and I hide it better than some people could, you know.  So I'll just, I'm not going to able myself to eat brownies that I said that, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.  So you still have lithium from last time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And a refill.  You know, I would say let's, let's try and stretch it out.  Let's meet in 6 weeks or something.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Six weeks, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, um, obviously any change let me know, but.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I will.  You know I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're doing extremely well and, uh, hopefully this is it.  You know, [INAUDIBLE] continue to do well.  As I said, there are other, at some point because it seems like it's such a good dosage for you, at some point I think I'd like to switch you to a slow release preparation because it's a feeling that long term it might be safer, long term, uh, but I don't want to do that now because I don't want to do anything right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But maybe in a couple of months.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Switch you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's been real good for several months.  And, uh, and that's the only, if you stay well that's the only change I'd make.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what is the difference in that as far as perception, anything?  When you first start it, when you first take it, like the change?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The concern about lithium is that long term, meaning decades, there's a concern about it harming the kidneys.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So the way to minimize the risk is minimize the dosage.  Now if you're on, like you're doing a low dosage.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And they also feel perhaps that being on slow release so it doesn't keep as high would be desirable too.  That's the only difference.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In other words, the same area under the curve, same amount of medicine going into your body, but instead of it peaking like that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Stable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It maintains its level a little better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So I think, uh, I'd like to try that at some point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But not today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To change it right now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's the only thing I would think of.  Very simple.  I wish it was always this easy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of people who, you know, it's kind of, you know, the kind of symptoms that you have, 2 or 3 or 4 things.  So lithium I think I said this to you, it's probably underutilized.  It's an older medicine; some people think it has a scary vibe to it.  And, uh—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's been stigmatized.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not promoted like the newer medicines.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  I think Abilify seems scary to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Abilify, they advertised on TV.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know, I've seen it.  But then they go down like what the, what could possibly happen, I'm like oh, wow, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll take the tremor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Unfortunately, a lot of medicine, I mean most medicines have a list of potentially have side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, uh, I think they feel that unbalanced people notice the lady walking out of the woods and seeming happier.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, as compared to hearing the side effects.  And for some people it's a nice medicine.  But for the kind of symptoms that you were having, lithium is really—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I'm more, definitely I was more manic than depressive.  Like when I would come down it just that normal would be such a bummer at that point.  I'm just like because I'm not up and, you know, being manic, normal, manic, normal, and occasional depressed, you know, but very rarely, you know.  If I had the depressive episode then I'd end up in the hospital, you know.  Like that's what would happen with me.  I would like end up in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

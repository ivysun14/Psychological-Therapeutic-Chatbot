<p>PATIENT: (3-minute silence, Sniff) It's very strange to me because (Clears throat) for, this is the first time for a long time that I've been aware of thinking of something that I didn't particularly want to say.  And then, I was thinking of something right before I came in.  But now it's as if I can't think of anything else until I say what I don't want to say.  Because when I came in here I noticed a particular odor.  And what it made me think of was somebody's unwashed body.  And I think I almost, I, I, I don't know whether in a way I'm associating it with you, but when I lay down on the couch I didn't want to lie down because I was associating it mainly, that this, somebody must have just been in here who was lying here, who was unwashed in some way.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>But I think perhaps I didn't want to say this, because somehow I thought you might take offense or — in some way I do connect it with you.  (Pause)  And I al—, right now I also wonder if I am connecting it with you, and I'm afraid you might take offense.  If it's something that I'm noticing because I do want to be hostile.  Because I never remember noticing a smell like this before.  And now that I've mentioned it I can't really notice it, either.  (Silence)</p>

<p>What I was thinking before I came in and I was just realizing now that (Clears throat) in a way, too, noticing the smell was a nice way to avoid thinking about what I had been.  What I was thinking about and remembered again was a dream I had last night or this morning when I woke up.  And it was very vivid.  It's the first time that I — or at least it seemed so when I was sitting out waiting to come in — that I could recall so many details.  Now, when I think of it I can't recall the first part. </p>

<p>But it was a dream about MSCZ and the fact he, I think in the beginning of the dream he said something to me or, uh, it isn't clear now.  But in any case, I knew he was going t—, off and leaving me.  And it started out that he was leaving me because he was going to commit suicide.  And I went after him and I had to get directions.  And then the dream began to develop that there was a conspiracy, and that MSCZ was sort of a, I don't know, victim of the conspiracy, and that either they wo—, these people were making him commit suicide, or having him do something and then at the end he was going to commit suicide. </p>

<p>But in any case, the part I remember now is running after MSCZ down a long road where there were woods on either side.  And somebody coming after me, and then seeing MSCZ run across the road 
and thinking he was about to jump in the lake and drown himself.  And my trying to catch up with MSCZ and then another person appearing, who said that it wasn't my husband and trying to stop me, head me off in some way, and I woke up still trying to reach MSCZ.  And I couldn't understand why I associated my having the dream with the fact that last night, MSCZ wanted to make love w—, to me and I didn't want him to, because it was late.  And, and I don't know, it just seemed like I had all the reasons why not.  And he w—, he n—, he didn't get annoyed or anything, but I know it bothers him when I don't want him to. </p>

<p>But then just now I remembered too, that last night I, right before I went to sleep, I read a short story.  And in it a man does try to commit suicide and uh, I don't know, it just seemed now it must be why I chose that particular thing.  But if it, the main feeling I got was that MSCZ had deserted me and I was trying to get him back.  (Sniff)  And when I woke up, I hadn't gotten him back.  And I was, I knew it was a dream, and I was a re—, had the relief that you have after a dream you don't like.  But on the other hand, it was as if it really weren't a dream, and that I was very glad MSCZ was there.  But that I wasn't feeling that secure in his always being there or that his, that he would stay there.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I was just thinking that I've sort o—, I'm sort of running through all my little — well they're not so little — but all the insecurities I have, or feelings of inadequacy.  Because I talked about school, and feeling I couldn't really do things there.  And then I've talked about how I feel I can't either become pregnant or be a good mother.  And now I'm talking about how I don't think I can keep MSCZ.</p>

<p>And it was funny, today something was sort of on the back of my mind, sort of disturbing me.  And I couldn't think what, but right now it, just something occurs to me that I think was part of it.  Part was that I gave FHYZ some of my reports, and I immediately wanted to explain everything to her, and yet I was trying not to and—, because it wasn't, I mean, what was there to explain, I kept saying to myself.  And yet somehow vaguely, I felt uneasy.  But then the other thing was this feeling that I can't do things now because of the way I'm feeling, about myself and all.  But that I know I can if I just felt better about myself, and it, but it seemed to hold me right in the middle of feeling that I can't do things and feeling I can.  So it was almost as if I wasn't sure which way to think.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Uh, well, I think part of this feeling comes, too, from the fact that uhm, I had certain things planned today.  And then it, I found out that uhm, there would be a movie for the children.  And so we did — this comes uh, uh, what would be second period in the day.  So we did what we'd planned to do first anyway, because it involved some other people, so I couldn't really change that.  But then the children were obviously so exhausted, that I couldn't do anything else I'd planned for the day, and I had to readjust according to the way the children were feeling.  And the day went very well.  But yet, the feeling — and I, so I knew if I just attuned myself to the children, things will work well.  But yet, on the other hand I kept feeling I didn't get done what I'd planned for today.  And I think that was part, vaguely bothering me, too.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I just realized I'd stopped, gotten off from that dream and thinking about MSCZ, and then I started thinking of what I'd said, that if I attune myself to the boys I can do well as a teacher, even though I may not be covering what I had planned.  And it just struck me that I know very well also that MSCZ's very happy if I've been trying to attune myself to him and be considerate of him. </p>

<p>ANALYST: Yeah, you know you said that you in the dream discovered there was a conspiracy to do him in.  Sounds like you're the conspirator — huh? — in your view.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mm.  Yes, because that was the strange thing about the dream.  I just remembered this now.  I mean, the dream never ended, but I had the feeling in the dream that these people who were now — somebody was coming up behind me, and then this person who came at another direction to cut me off — weren't going to do anything to me except keep me from getting to MSCZ.  (Pause)</p>

<p>But the way I conspire against MSCZ or anyone is by putting myself first.  (Silence)</p>

<p>I just thought of something else connected with the reports that uhm, I think occurred to me last night.  More clearly, it occurred to me before, too, when I was doing one particular report in which I had written on that back general statement, 1 very brief paragraph where I'd summed up everything.  And then I felt, I gave sort of examples of what I'd said when I wrote further.  But in a way I felt it didn't have to be there. </p>

<p>And I've never felt that way before, and then last night I wrote quite short ones on the back where I usually write very long ones.  And again, I was feeling well, I've really said it, and I can just go into lots of detail and description.  But in a way, there's no point.  If the parent wants it then they can call and come in for a conference.  And it made me think back to the first time I had written reports.  And the supervisor then had become quite upset that I wrote such long ones, and how I didn't really need everything I was putting in.  And, and I remembered that I hadn't understood what she meant then.  Because it seemed to me each thing was different.  And I was realizing that really for the first time, I understood. </p>

<p>But somehow again, it was, I was sort of nervous about the reports I wrote last night while I was doing them, mainly because it seemed I wasn't saying enough.  And therefore, I must be missing something.  Even though I knew I had said all there was to say.  (Pause) And then I went to bed and didn't want MSCZ to make love to me. </p>

<p>ANALYST: And how do you understand that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: W—, I don't (Breathes deeply, Pause), in a way I've already said it.  And I don't quite know how to say it again, except that I was thinking about myself and feeling somehow something was missing or wrong, inadequate about me.  And I didn't want to think about him, because I was too busy thinking about myself and trying to figure out what it was.  So then I wouldn't have the feeling I did of this vague dissatisfaction, I guess.  (Pause)  And when I use those words, it makes me think of again the fact I don't have a penis.  But, and maybe somehow I th—, was feeling that MSCZ's making love to me would somehow make me more aware of that.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: What were some other details in the dream?  I wonder if any of them bring anything to mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm sorry, I didn't quite —</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Interrupting) I said there were some other details in the dream that you specifically thought about.  Going down a road in the woods, for example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: What I think right, right away is that it was just, it was getting darker and further away from people.  Mo—, I was more alone and it was more frightening.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And, uh, I don't know, it was occurring to me that as far as I recall, there were only men in the dream, and me.  And so I had this feeling that along with being alone and frightened, that I was sort of helpless, too, if the men were against me in any way, like trying to stop me from doing something.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And yet I also had the feeling right at the end of the dream when the person behind me was still behind me, but the person that was trying to head me off was sort of there.  There had been no contact between us.  He hadn't tried to hold me and stop me or hurt me in any way.  But yet I had the feeling that my attitude was I was going to fight, so that I could keep on going.  I wasn't going to just, because he was a man and was trying to stop me, just stop.  Yet somehow, it makes me think of my father and how I always was fighting him.  But I'm not sure why. </p>

<p>ANALYST: When you think of the man behind you, who do you think of?</p>

<p>PATIENT: My brother.  (Pause) And maybe this is what I was really doing in the dream.  It seems sort of unbelievable right now, but it just occurred to me that it's almost as if I were trying to get to MSCZ, because by getting to him I'd get his penis.  And then I'd have one.  And that makes me think again of the conspiracy was really me, because in a — that would destroy him.  (Sigh, Pause)</p>

<p>It makes me think back to what I said about the feeling I had earlier that evening of knowing I'd said what I wanted to say.  And therefore in, in that aspect, being confident.  And yet, vaguely feeling that somehow I hadn't done enough, and therefore feeling unconfident.  And then when I felt unconfident I wanted to, it seems like, get a penis.  And, I don't know, I'm somehow trying to, having trouble putting that together and understanding it.  Because other times it seems like I felt confident when somehow I was thinking of myself in some way as having as penis, or as somebody who could compete in a masculine way, anyway.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or maybe what I'm trying to work out is what distinctions there are and the kind of confidence I feel.  Because I just know that last night, the part of me that was feeling confident, or the times when I would think, I've said it and I've said it well and concisely and simply was just a part of this is what I think, and I'm not trying to impress anyone, and I've, I've said it.  And that's all I need to do.  And, I don't know, it seems like it has nothing to do with feeling competitive and trying to get a penis.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And it makes me think again of what I was thinking about the feeling I had at school today.  When I relaxed and sort of had a general idea of things I wanted to have the children learning to do, things went well.  And it, and when I try to stick to a plan which is involving producing things, not just learning sort of skills, but having proof of it, that I then get all tense and nervous and everything.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And so then I just think of the fact that I know I'm often feeling I have to prove myself, whether it's having material things to show how wonderful I am as a teacher, or if it's to sound really brilliant in conversation, or just what it is.  Or just the thing that bothers me about just being at home and not having a job, of what will I do then to prove myself?  Almost seems to be and it just seems to me right now, it all comes from feeling inadequate and unacceptable, which I can see could come from the fact that I was female and not male. </p>

<p>But then what will still puzzle me is (Sigh) — I just lost it again — I don't know, it has something to do with the fact that I had two sisters and — oh, I know — that I would still feel competitive with them.  Or I wouldn't think of them as being in exactly the same situation I was in, since there was a boy in the family.  (Sniff)  But somehow I saw it that not only was there MLWZ, and my parents having a very special attitude toward him, but then there were FNA and FYC who were also favored in some way or another.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And I went from thinking that to thinking of the reports that I have to write now.  And the fact that even though I was consciously trying to choose ones that might be easy along with ones that would be hard, each day I know what I've really done is cho—, I chose the boys that I felt stood out in some way or another, so I had some fairly clear idea of what I wanted to say.  And now I'm left with sort of the middle group.  They're middle in their performance at school and, I don't know, I just have a vaguer feeling about them, and therefore feeling how am I going to write these reports?</p>

<p>ANALYST: If something doesn't stand out about them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Sigh) I just refuse (Chuckle) to think what I think when you say that.  (Pause)  Although, for the first time, it, it, I can see how I might have gotten the importance on penises the way I have, because that was the visual difference, and so then it would seem that was what caused it all — caused all the attention and so forth, that MLWZ got.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just started thinking about my father's family, really.  And, I don't know, sort of distinguishing between the kinds of attitudes my mother and then my father had toward MLWZ.  And my mother's being just sort of the normal feeling a woman would have if she'd had 3 daughters and then had a son.  Because I think any woman wants a son, probably any man wants a son, too. </p>

<p>But, and I was just thinking that in my father's family from stories I've heard, his family had this, the, sort of the European attitude toward the male child.  He was special and he got special types of privileges.  And his mother was very hard on the daughters, it s—, it seems to me from what I've heard, whereas, he was allowed to do all sorts of things.  And I, I don't know, I was just starting to feel sorry for his 2 sisters.  And then thinking especially about the one who com—, I assume committed suicide.  I mean that's what, it was all kind of a mystery and people have, my mother I know, believes that.  And probably I do as a result.  But it would make sense.  (Sniff, Pause)</p>

<p>And I, right now I sort of feel sorry for my father, too.  Because one sister commits suicide, who's the one he liked best.  And then, the other one has an illegitimate child and becomes just a very fat, sort of unattractive woman.  Unattractive not only because she's fat, but just from the way her personality develops after, I don't know what she was before, but I think she might have been quite a bit nicer before.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I also think about my father's mother, who — I don't know whether this has anything to do with my feelings about my father — but, I think I used to feel guilty, because I never liked his mother.  And I suppose part of the guilt might have come from, she was my grandmother and you're not supposed to not like your grandmothers.  But then also I really liked my other grandmother, my mother's mother.  (Sniff)</p>

<p>Uh, uh, it—, his mother was unattractive, very unattractive by the time I knew her, but I don't think that's what would have bothered me.  The thing I remember is that she had absolutely no interested in us, his children.  I'm not sure if she did in MLWZ, but I know she didn't in any of us girls.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST: (Coughs) Well, our time's up.

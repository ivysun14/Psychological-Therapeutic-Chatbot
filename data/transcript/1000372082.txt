<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well or I'll say, 'I don't have anything to say'.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: June 15th, the 10th interview. (0:08)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Good gosh. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did (inaudible 0:15)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, (inaudible 0:17). It's kind of more horrible because what happened was I was at work and Murphy was away for the weekend in Chicago. I came home from work Sunday night at midnight and I walked in and I kicked the screw across the floor. It turned out that the straight (inaudible 0:34) on the door frame knocked off entirely (inaudible 0:42) crap lying around. I walked in, turned on the light and said, "Gee (inaudible 0:46) home again. I turned around and it was fine.</p>

<p>And I eventually went and on the lights and said, 'Gee I'd like some music and know that Terry would like it when he gets home', and turned around and it was gone. And it's not ours, it's belongs to a friend of ours who left it with us  (inaudible 0:53). So I got over to my next door neighbors sister would maybe taken it and call the cops. I'm sure he'd be in the apartment if he was hiding underneath anything, but he wasn't. So that was it - wow, what a trip! Shit. I would feel better if they had taken something of ours also...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A-ha. Well, we weren't really...outside the emotional hassle for us, materially, nothing happened to us. It sounds like we were out money or something that we use all the time. Our friend is out $300 - Mandy - she worked with Dr Owens. We would kind of feel better for her if we too had had something taken - kind of equalizing our misplaced guilt.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You would be suffering too - you would have paid.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Then it would be more equal, rather than somebody breaking into our house and taking her things - and not our things. So we've just been really uptight for the past few days. We spent most of yesterday sitting waiting for the locksmith to come. That was great - just sitting and waiting. So we put a false lock on the door. He went into the bathroom last night and tripped over! (chuckles) So we're starting to calm down and I finally got in touch the girl and she was really neat about it. She didn't get upset - at least not on the phone. She was very philosophical about the whole thing. We were really shaken, also in terms of just somebody being able to break in.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah you feel much more vulnerable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and are they going to come back? The place is just crammed with small appliances and luxuries. Once they've seen them they will want. We figure if they want to come in and break down the door around the fox lock (3:03). It was really upsetting yesterday; it was really, really tense. We also had to move some furniture. My old room mates were moving and I asked if I could take some stuff and it was the same process when we try and build anything. It was just this terrible fight; we were just screaming at each other and crying. (3:29).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Over what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Over moving it and having hassles moving it through the door. And all the tension of not being able to get in touch with Jane and waiting for the locksmith. Was the guy going to come back? Should one of us stay in the apartment that night? Should Murphy stay at home just in case he does try to get in again and maybe we can catch him? And, you know, feeling responsible for the record player but knowing we can't replace it because we just don't have the money.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was all that, so that even made it...I guess that fight worked?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, except in a way it made it better.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How was that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because we usually only have a fight like and I didn't feel that way. I didn't feel like I just wanted to pick up and leave. I didn't feel that once we were having a fight and Murphy was having all this hassle moving with stuff which didn't bother me at all; that he was any less desirable; that I loved him less; that he was any less of a man. We were having this stupid fight and I just wanted to put the fight aside but I didn't want to leave. I was a little pissed at him but not as badly as I usually am and I really felt good about that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of describe that a bit, some of these other bad things that...(Inaudible 5:07)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, on top of that too.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How should that make it better then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I guess it is kind of...he has got a reason for getting really upset and not being able to have him move in with furniture. So I think if it were just any day and we agreed to do this and went over, did it and then he felt too cocky before getting really upset and start yelling at me that I should be able to do this.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He doesn't look at it very rationally.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, there are all kinds of really good reasons why this would be just the final straw; just one more hassle on top of 500 other hassles.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Does that mean that this one doesn't really count on that chain of, you know, that kind of pattern?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It does, because it still arose out of a specific situation of having to move something; having to do something with his hands. He was fine. But I guess I was just able to accept it, whereas I wasn't able to, especially when (inaudible 6:24). It passed really quickly and I was able (6:29) to react towards him rather than away from him. And we kind of let it pass. The best thing about the weekend was, I was kind of expecting when he was gone I wouldn't miss him and I would be kind of glad he was gone but I missed him. I was really relieved when he came home, which made me feel really good, because I was afraid that I wouldn't miss him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was a relief.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was nice. I think also it helped me to cope with yesterday's tension. I was really feeling very, very warmly towards him and still am today. It proved to us how much we really loved one another and wanted to be together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, so you kind of had a day of this - of knowing that you cared. That you cared a lot.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was sort of a concrete example, pointing out something that sometimes we take for granted, or intentionally flounder. That was nice. He's really getting pissed off with my former room mate, Chrissie. I don't know, they're just not getting along very well at the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is she kind of your friends with him too?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she's kind of pissing me off too at the moment. It is really obvious that she is very uncomfortable with Murphy there, they're starting to rub against one another. Also, she gets impossible when she moves - she just pestered us off the past week about moving her stuff. She called yesterday and she called before...she knew he had been pissed and she called. The only thing she said to Murphy was, "Why don't you come over and get the furniture; can I talk to Ann." That was really stupid. Sometimes she is really inconsiderate and nagging. It really annoyed me. She keeps on brushing Murphy off. I can see they are not getting along but I don't know what to do about it. 0:09:27.0</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You want them to be getting along better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You have to deal with the consequences of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is difficult to have to face...Murphy will suggest something that we can do without her and I kind of think, "Well, I really want to propose that to Chrissie; I'm not sure she'll want to do it." I feel badly going over to see Chrissie without Murphy. Not overtly but all these underlying vibes especially from Chrissie - and a little from Murphy. If he starts getting ecstatic, he starts getting uncomfortable himself. And I don't know how to deal with the situation and what to do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What part of the situation: their not liking each other?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not liking each other; being uncomfortable with each other, meaning that if I did something with Chrissie, I had to do it alone but that makes Murphy feel uncomfortable. He would like to feel that she is his friend as well - which she is - but they haven't been getting along well in the past. And I don't want Murphy to feel excluded or she's down on him. or that she's not liking him. Also, he has the view that I say unkind things about him at my (inaudible 10:57) which implies a (inaudible 11:00) opinion of him. I would just like them to get along. It would be easier for me if he got along with more of my friends.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess the thing that I am seeing is: what are the things that could change or what are the things that he would like to have changed in that. One thing that you haven't told me: do you think Chrissie doesn't want Murphy around there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Chrissie doesn't want Murphy around there, yeah - I really think so. I think like...I started to tell you about that thing that happened out with him Saturday. A lot of it also has to do with the way Chrissie sees Murphy. She started to see this stereotyped image of him; his being much more helpless and much less in command of himself than he actually is. She sees him as someone who is very (inaudible 12:11); she's also seen him at some of his worst. She tends to generalize and see him as weaker than he is. Also, Chrissie is the person that I used to talk to the most in terms of things that were upsetting me about Murphy. She started to get a very lopsided view of him. I think this had a lot to do with how she's now uncomfortable with him. 0:12:39.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Uncomfortable?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually uncomfortable: she doesn't have much patience for him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible 12:48)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, of things he says and does. And if I say something about him, there is a little edge to her response - so that's kind of Murphy - and that's the last thing that I want. And so when I'm with Chrissie and Murphy I become defensive about Murphy - towards Chrissie and also towards Murphy. I'm kind of afraid that he will do something that Chrissie expects.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're afraid that he will prove Chrissie right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now that theory is of her keeping on having that image of him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, yeah, and being uncomfortable with him and so making it harder for me to see her.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So does that amount to saying that something is going to happen so she is going to be afraid it will come off on you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. It's very hard.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That relationship becomes...difficult, kind of thing. It's almost like if Murphy's f***** up, then I'm not going to be able to se Chrissie as much.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, exactly. Usually the times when I sit down are also the times that whatever I would do I would be doing with Murphy. And they are usually things that he would like to do also, unless they are shopping for material or something like that. (Inaudible 14:22) called and said, "Do you want to go up north for the wine and cheese show?" And, of course, we both want to do that. Or, you know, this and that, or come out to supper. Obviously, I can't just come out to supper. The only time we would do something alone is during the year we would have lunch together and we would sit and talk for an hour or two. Like, during the summer, Murphy and I...especially the way I scheduled my summer; it is really tight and composed of things that mostly I will be doing myself. My free time we really like to spend together. And it's really nice when Chrissie and Murphy are getting along and the three of us do things together or she and Jeff, and Murphy and I, do things. It makes me feel really good. However, if she didn't particularly want to be around Murphy because she was uncomfortable with him or annoyed at the things that he was doing, or felt he was bad for me - which is another trip she's on - then I wouldn't see her as much. It would be much more difficult for me to see her if I had to see her by myself at a time when it was not being forced to Murphy. 0:15:35.1</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so there are several issues: one of them anyway is that how she sees it. You don't know, I guess - we've not really talked about it - whether it is really accurate to say, however she feels about him, she doesn't want to see him; she doesn't want to be around him. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, also I'm less likely to say, "Alright, let's do that," because I just feel the tension, a kind of strange interaction between the two of them. I see her reactions and then I become uncomfortable.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I probably have a fear that Murphy will alienate my son because he is a very difficult person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So when you say you're reacting in little ways, in ways that look bad, is that (inaudible 16:58)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and if he only made sure, even though she and I are friends - which, once again, it is much more difficult for me to see. It is just physically very difficult in terms of arranging time to be able to see Chrissie. And also because then there's Murphy - after a while, it hurts. He's been saying for about two months, "I don't think Chrissie respects me. I think Chrissie is really uncomfortable with me. I don't think she likes me very much." And then I'm kind of upset about it and I don't know what to do. I've just been saying, "No, they're just hassled about a lot of stuff.". What can I say, "Chrissie doesn't like you very much?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it seems like it's true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is, I think - I think so, and it upsets me very much. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what can you possibly do about it? 0:18:01.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, one thing...I mean, I don't know what you can do a whole lot. The kind of way of sketching it out, he does these things to alienate her and there are vibrations. One way that that situation could change is if he comes to or you come to or agree that those things are bad things to be doing and he shouldn't do those things that are alienating them.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or else he could say, "Well, I want to do those things."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but the things that are alienating are usually not directly direct things towards them that alienate.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A-ha.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it is a combination of...like, the way I was talking about him (inaudible 18:50) and the indirect thing in terms of....things I would say in ways, "Well, I won't do that because Murphy won't like that." Or, "Well, let's not plan on doing that because that would upset Murphy." </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's really your kind of reacting to things he does as much to your picture of him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or to the picture they think they get from the way he treats me. They are kind of reacting around me and the way they think I am being treated. Chrissie said to me, "I feel much closer to you than I do to Murphy. If it weren't for you I wouldn't have any contact with Murphy." She said, "I think Mable feels the same way." Mable being Chrissie's room mate now. We like Chrissie and Mable very, very much; both of us do - Murphy and I. And I kind of feel as if in some way it is my fault and I don't exactly know what to do about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How is it your fault?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, they seem, between things I've said and indirect references to Murphy, they felt that I am very, very unhappy and he is treating me very badly and I don't have the strength to get out. And I've watched...first of all, I've put myself in a situation where even if it was terrible, I couldn't get out. They are just feeling very negatively towards him because they feel he's bad for me. I don't think that's true at all - I think that's stupid! (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, what about it is stupid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's not bad for me. The trouble is that one of my basic characteristics is that I bitch a lot. Where Murphy will get mad and hit something, I'll talk about it for a while. I'll bitch and get it off my chest and I will make it sound worse than it actually is - and then I will forget about it. I really bitch a lot and for a while the person I was bitching to is Chrissie and she said it was starting to affect her opinion of Murphy. So in some ways I feel that I am responsible. 0:21:14.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You usually just think of it as a characteristic - just a thing you do - as having consequences.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, also it is really easy to get into this trip of resenting Murphy because he alienates my friends and I don't see al my friends and I don't have time for them. They don't come over because they don't know him; they don't even like him. And I can't go over there because I don't have the time to do it alone but I can't bring him. There are times when I start to fall into feeling badly about not really being with anybody that I was close to before - my immediate peer group.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you mean it makes you feel bad about it? How come you call it a trap that you fall into? To say that they can see that as unrealistic or unfair reaction almost?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I think it is because...it's not...let's say it is 75 per cent not his fault that he is the person that he is. I mean, the thing s that people usually object to in his personality are just things that are part of him that there's no way you'd change. He is outspoken; he has very strong opinions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand; it sounds like then you are saying you can't resent someone for the things they can't change. Well, they are things that can't change. I don't know, maybe you shouldn't have done them but I can't see not liking him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, like when I am feeling kind of open, in one sense I don't. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Those things, for whatever reason, are having a bad effect on your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, they are not usually things that I can put my finger on; they are just Murphy, the way he interacts with people. The way I feel when he is with certain groups of people that I'm comfortable with and he's not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now that's a general reason: how people interact - the general way. How come you like certain people and don't like others?</p>

<p>CLIENT: right, but he doesn't interact well with, like..he kind of interacts well with Chrissie and Mable, depending on how they are feeling about him. He doesn't interact well with Chrissie and Jeff because he really dislikes Jeff. He doesn't interact well with friends of mine that he considers are immature and youngish type friends. He certainly doesn't interact well with any of my friends who are druggie in any way. He just dislikes the hippy...he doesn't dislike it but he doesn't get along with my friends who are that way for some reason. Some of his own friends are like that. It's just really strange. I don't know. I also don't know how much of it is my trying to second guess his effect; kind of downgrading him and saying, "Well, he won't interact well this way because he is just that way and he's strange and he is finicky." And being unfair to him. 0:24:50.9</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of you labeling (24:52) him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, kind of what I was doing when I created the whole thing that time. Expecting him to act that way; so forcing him into that situation?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, what do you think? Do you think that happens much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it happens. and there's the indirect thing of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do you think it happens at times when you should know how to affect that?</p>

<p>Let me tell you what I think: kind of, like, we always judge on the basis of past experiences in any way. It seems like it is pretty reasonable to make - I don't know about the judgments you make - often it seems pretty reasonable to someone back in the X fashion 10 out of 12 times before (25:46), expect they are going to act that way. One.</p>

<p>Two: another reason that makes sense a lot of times you make that kind of judgment based on what you have to sit and watch, is that you see things in common between the situation...there's almost something in common between the situation and other situations where you've seen him mess up on. Not just being (inaudible 26:16) but people back up in certain situations and people have certain things in common.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: One of the problems; I guess one thing that makes me define, so in that in itself doesn’t seem like a problem, to expect the same behavior as in the past, when there is something in common between that situation and this one.  (26:28)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of, when it seems like it's more of, people often do define us (26:40).</p> 

<p>CLIENT: He has a problem when I talk about him like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But when it seems like - I was going to say more of a problem or something - is when you are making a judgment that really there are more things that should tell you; that should include you; that it isn't the same, what is happening. When you think you are making an incorrect judgment in thinking that this is the same... 0:27:00.2</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, the thing is that the situations are pretty much...seem to have that co-relation but the problem is that I am selectively choosing from past reactions. The far past reactions are bad reactions, like all the reactions last year and some during the summer. The most recent reactions are really good reactions: strong, intelligent, feeling sensitive reactions. I'm ignoring them every time I'm making an estimate of how he is going to react to the current situation and that is totally skewed, because he is more likely to react if he is reacting in the immediate present than he has in the far past. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I still have these very low expectations of him and I haven't recognized his change. It is pretty devastating for him to realize that he is trying very hard to change and succeeding, and to find that I am still expecting him to be mad and not recognize that he is changing himself. I don't know if that is a natural path; I don't know (inaudible 28:16). I was going to say that quantity does have something to do with it. The quantity of your impressions and simply the reasons having not outweighed....</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of want them to have more impact on you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Subconsciously remember those things about Murphy. He's just so much more (inaudible 28:51) - he's just so fine. Like, Sunday night he was absolutely a rock. I was really upset and I was kind of expecting him to be much more upset than he was - to lean on me at least as much as I was leaning on him. That just didn't happen the way it used to, which was that I would fall apart and start to get myself together again and he would break and I would spend all my energy taking care of him. He just really kept himself together. He saw that I was very upset and very (inaudible 29:30), and called on help from me very carefully, whilst still giving me a great sense of support. He just handled the situation with great calm. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And now your problem is that he is changing...your problem is with his changing in situations like that, where he does come through, or in situations where you are unsure - you haven't seen what he does or is going to do this time? 0:30:08.3</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well no, whenever he just comes through it is just fantastic - it is a really fine thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then you don't have a problem recognizing what he is doing for what it is and appreciating it when he actually does that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, but what if when my expectations set the whole situation against him? When I precipitate a crisis because I expect him act in a certain way. When I get hysterical in advance before he has said anything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you get hysterical in advance? I mean, even if he was going to do that, why do you do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just get really excited. It's like feeling like a bad thing is going to happen. I want to do something about it; what do I do? I feel sort of paralyzed; I feel like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of desperate.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and I force him into a bad position.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't see how that can (31:14)  I see what you are saying...</p>

<p>CLIENT: My actions get irritating. I begin to relate to him as if he were doing what I expect him to do when he is not doing it at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So do you get angry at him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I get fearful; I get kind of angry and I just stop relating to him entirely and start pushing him into my expectations.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I react to him is if he were doing what I expect him to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I react to him as if we were lying to me and not telling me how he really feels. And after enough of that, he gets mad - I mean, he gets angry. He starts feeling what I expect him to feel.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it starts out you kind of perceiving him as not telling you that he is really bothered: what do you do then?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of become very ministering, you know, I become very soothing, you know, "Are you okay? What would you like to do?"</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you kind of say, "Oh come on, it's okay if you tell me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: I kind of pat him on the head or the back...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to comfort him, you mean, kind of coax him out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And to calm him down and not to get upset. I kind of treat him like a child. I placate him. It becomes immediately obvious from my entire posture that I am placating him - nothing else. I'm not listening to him; I'm not relating to him - I'm placating him. Especially when I placate him for no reason and that's really annoying. 0:33:05.2</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, how about when you placate him for a reason because it seems like, in fact, you think you've got a reason for those times...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's annoying too when I placate him for a reason because that means I am kind of shutting him off as a person and I am just doing anything to shut him off - which is pretty much what I am doing when I am placating him. I would do anything to make him (inaudible 33:30). I don't like that at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think you are reacting to if that seems like that is the best reaction you can have?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, my feeling is that I just really hated when he became upset. I just didn't want to have anything to do with it. I wanted to move the situation down so that we can attack whatever problem we have to attack and come to a solution. Anger, to me, seems to be a total waste of time. I just don't have any patience for it. I see it as a completely destructive emotion and I figure that if I can placate Murphy and calm him down then we can (inaudible 34:22). Then we can constructively attack where it is happening. So I do try and placate him and make him be quiet. As long as they pull themselves together; I guess that's how I feel about it. I keep on expecting him to fall apart. I think that is an unfair expectation, thinking (inaudible 34:52). I am beginning to realize more and more he is not going to fall apart and that makes me feel much better. (Inaudible 35:10) feeling worse about him as well, expecting him not to be able to control his anger (inaudible 35:16). He used to do that a lot more frequently than he does now. But I still have these expectations that he would.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just realized that one of the problems is that he hasn't changed completely.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's a difference in probability - that there's still that probability. Is this true? 0:36:03.8</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're not (inaudible 36:06)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he's going to at some point. I mean, the fantastic thing about him is that he has been (inaudible 36:22) in a bad way and it upsets you and I'm going to make an effort to control these (inaudible 36:34). And he is doing it and he is controlling it. I think I have no expectations for him - at least I have no intellectual expectations for him to change completely because that is totally unreasonable. If you love somebody you don't ask them to change for you; to change their entire personality for you. Also, I have a certain degree of (inaudible 37:05). I guess the only thing that I don't accept is when he gets hysterical about building something or moving something. That's the only part of his personality that I haven't been able to (inaudible 37:21). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: In fact, do you want it to change so you can accept that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that can change but I know that in some way I am unrealistic and unfair.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't understand that. What I meant was: do you want to change yourself so that you can accept that change - that reaction?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, in a very real way I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What real way is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Life would be so much simpler if I would just accept this and not half of me wish that he would do it or kind of put him in a situation where he would volunteer to do it and then get mad, or ask him to do something which I know was sinful.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so if it simply didn't bother you that you were doing these things by yourself...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then they would get done and they wouldn't bother me. But just logically and physically it is impossible to do many of these things by myself. I just don't have a (inaudible 38:49).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not practical as a solution. Is that the main problem, just looking at it kind of (inaudible 38:58)? 0:39:00.4</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, kind of the emotional dimension where I just really would like him to be able to do things with me. I just really like the idea of the two of us being able to move around the house together. It's kind of an (inaudible 39:20).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What does that mean to you - this way (inaudible 39:25)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The self sufficiency and the competence.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For yourself or as a couple?</p>

<p>CLIENT: As a couple - being an autonomous unit, able to do various things for themselves - don't have to have anyone else doing it for them. Having a certain degree of independence and maturity so that in the end they can accomplish in a very physical way. Most of these things are not the type of things you can hire someone to do unless you had a general handyman you hired. It's absolutely impossible ask your friends to continually play handyman for you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's again getting back to the thing about practicality, which I guess is about 80 per cent of the thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. Practically, it is very, very important. Like, we moved the kitchen table; we moved a chair yesterday - there was a bureau left. What I am doing is Murphy and I are not going to move. I've gotten two people from the restaurant - two of the (inaudible 40:49) - and given them five bucks between the two of them - whatever they think is fair. They will move it for me. What I was going to do, and Murphy also, was 10 minutes before they come, I am going to tell him they are coming and he's going to split so that he doesn't have to be there and be embarrassed. It seems like a f****** hell of a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To save him embarrassment?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To get the bureau?</p>

<p>CLIENT: First, the bureau was free, which is nice. It's a nice bureau. I can really use it for keeping linens. So now it's convenient - it really helps a lot. Besides, having to get someone to come specifically to move it and to pay them; to figure out a time that they can make it and I can make it; people whose apartment the bureau is in can make it. (Inaudible 41:44) to get them to do it and also, at the same time, salvage Murphy's pride. It seems to be that instead of traveling in a straight line, I was traveling in a circle. If this could be done with so much less, it would be so much easier. And I'd (inaudible 42:03) in some way this was silly. 0:42:10.4</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But in the present state of things, there's a simpler way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Emotionally, it would be much less hassle - in terms of emotional wear and tear. I figured that (inaudible 42:23) not having another thing to fight about, and not having Murphy to start. Id' be in tears, so I'm getting used to the idea - being adjusted to it - but I don't particularly like it. I don't like it being me or him as helpless. I find that very (inaudible 42:45) and something that I dislike intensely.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So the idea of you having to go and do all the organizing around him, is like saying that he can't do that here?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's kind of a waste of effort.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A waste of effort - how is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A waste of effort, how come? (43:08).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just that he was capable of doing this, but I can't make him feel that he can do it. This is not something that he is going to work at and change - he is not (43:21).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean he is not?</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is something he knows he can't do and that's all - he's not going to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, it seems like there are different issues involved: what is it that you both agree that he can't do? Moving the bureau?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Moving the bureau and not getting hysterical. Move the bureau without figuring that he will scrape the walls when moving it. Build anything; hammering a nail; hold up something for me to hammer; help me, like when putting a covering over the hall door. There's a doorway where we put a plastic sheet up that we can hook it up in such a way so that we can run the air conditioner with the bedroom door open so we can pull the living room too. He can't do that. He was so hysterical having to put up eight tacks - it was just so awful. I was just so mad at him. It comes down to him saying that he has no patience for it - that he gets too impatient - which he does and that's when he botches the whole thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, we all agree he has no patience for it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, the question is I guess, how deep is that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: To him that is an absolute. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's like (inaudible 44:48)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, as far as he is concerned, he doesn't have any patience for this and therefore he cannot do it, and therefore we will not do it. It's finished - that's it - and I should stop bugging him about it. 0:45:01.7</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bullshit - that's what I think! I think he could do it if he wanted to. I think if it meant enough. I guess I can come down and say if it meant enough to him to have it done he would find a way to do it. But then again, I can't make him care about it enough to find the patience for it himself. It is obviously a long standing thing of his, where he just hasn't been able to do it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I approached (inaudible 45:48) because he wasn't able to do it at first - he isn't able to do it now. And then he has all sorts of hassles about it - double feelings and guilt feelings on virility trips and stuff like that. Bad memories from high school, shock, of all things. It all gets incredibly complicated. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I guess I may not accept it emotionally but intellectually I think it's something I'm just going to have to remove from my mind.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean: you don't accept it emotionally?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean every time it comes up, I'm going to be (inaudible 46:35) but I'm worried that I just have to shelf my annoyance, not bother him and figure out some other way to get it done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because there is nothing that I can do about it. I'm tired of batting my head against the wall. I'm tired of our getting into fights about it. I'm tired of us screaming at one other; my crying and his yelling at me: that I'm trying to make him do these things and I'm trying to change him, and I should just stop it and leave him alone. And if I don't like him the way he is I should just leave, which is what he said yesterday. "What do you want from me. If this is what you expect from me, then you should just get out. But I'm not going to do it; I can't do it; I'm not going to do it." It's a dead end.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you have kind of decided, well, you'll just put that completely on the shelf and, you know, forget it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'll try; I didn't really try before I admit. I just really didn't try very much because I was really hoping that he would make more of an effort. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why do you keep asking? Is it because...I remember when we talked bout it a couple of times ago, and that seemed to me like you weren't talking about it a thing that was 80 per cent practical hassle at all. You were talking about a thing that was relatively central - and maybe (inaudible 48:03) some of that - but it was relatively central because for him not to do that or to try not to those things meant certain things about him. Meant not just that it was two more hours and five dollars worth for you here, but meant that he was the kind of person that you didn't know if you endorsed. You didn't know if you wanted to be around him. There's that aspect of him; when he wants that, wouldn't you say? 0:48:28.7</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He wasn't a person that you wanted to be around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Sometimes...maybe it's just...I am not sure why I'm acting this way but I mean it's like saying, "Okay, well, what does it mean?" I just keep saying, "What does it mean then?" It's kind of disturbing to say, "Well, I'm just never going to get into a situation where I see that thing about him." Which is exactly what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly what I'm doing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I can't say. I mean, like sometimes you've said things like that don't work; you can't ignore that stuff. I don't know, maybe it could work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Obviously, I'm going to overlook this fault in him because I have for a year and a half.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean, overlook?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, I haven't walked out on him in the middle of one of these fights, or if I have walked out, I've come back. We've managed to patch up; we've managed to find another solution. So in the end what is happening is that I am overlooking his faults. Wouldn't it be so good if I had started at the beginning and overlooked his faults, as opposed to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean behaviorally, you are overlooking it anyway because behaviorally you are not acting on it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, behaviorally I still love him a great deal and I want to live with him - I want to be with him. And though this fault of his upsets me a great deal - and intellectually and theoretically upsets me in terms of deductions I make from it - behaviorally I stay with it, so I should stop upsetting myself.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or should decide whether it is a big thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A thing you should do.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: See, the other thing that I am not clear on exactly is what it is that bothers you about it. I mean, what bothers me about it is the defining of it as a basic eye color kind of thing. What seems to bothers you more...I can't tell what bothers you. What bothers you is that he doesn't do a thing, or that he doesn't try to do it. I guess another thing which we haven't talked about that I have just thought of as a possibility is that where people can change, not particularly with the thing that they do but with trying to change their reactions to things that are keeping them from doing things. 0:51:04.6</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's a combination of all three. I mean, what's really bothering me, alright, if we would both get up on matters and look at the thing and go through this and go through that, and after half an hour look at each other and go, "No, this isn't working. We really don't know what the hell we are doing. Why don't we see if we can get so and so, but why don't we try it again tomorrow?" Or, "Well, we tried." And then we get down and we kind of feel, "Oh shit, we've both kind of gone through the doughnuts and the coffee. We will go downstairs and take a walk or something." Well, instead, he won't try to begin with.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean, try what? Try to find the patience or try to do the thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Both. He won't try to get up the patience to do the thing. Or he'll try to get up...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You see, what I think maybe what's happening is that you are trying to do the thing without developing a reaction - the patience - first. I know they kind of fit together - maybe they completely fit together - but I don't think so. Well, what bothers you is what? That he's not trying to approach that area of the thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or get himself to be able to.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, he's not doing anything with it. And then on top of that, what usually happens is he won't do anything about it, he then sets up an emotional and mental climate which renders me incapable of doing it some more.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not simple...what it amounts to is that when a hassle like this happens, it's not simply that he's not doing the thing, but it is also that the thing isn't getting done - and you can't do anything. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So another place where things could move or change - or another thing - theoretically could change, is if you could get yourself not to be so upset about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what's happening now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, what's happening now is that you aren't letting him get...you are deciding that you aren't going to be...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I see.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like yesterday, I mean, you weren't getting so upset.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was getting through the stuff.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought you were saying what your solution is going to be is not get into a situation where he gets upset, because when he gets upset about this thing, you get upset and cannot do the thing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's my solution. Another solution would be for this thing to happen and to find a way of you not being so upset.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true. I've tried that and it just doesn't work because what happened was...first of all, by the time that I am in the middle of that situation I am too pissed to just pretend nothing happened.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That may be why you can't pretend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So my reaction, when I really get to work, I kind of box myself off when I get into work. I really get into what I am doing and I don't want to be bothered. "I'm putting up the air conditioner here." And I pissed off with him following me around. Like I stood in there and watched him, feeling guilty, he wasn't doing it. That didn't help. I was trying to get all these hostile vibes from him and, you know, he was trying to screw in a screw - the whole act. And finally he said, and I was having some hassles, and he said, "Do you want me to go out and do that?" And I said, "Yeah (inaudible 54:23). So he said, "Help me with this." I didn't know what he was doing. So he tromped out and I held the thing for about two minutes then he got furiously mad and he said, "I am not going to do this," and stormed back inside. That was so funny. I was fine until he...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You were just, like, being seduced into his (inaudible 54:45).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, and then having him throw it back in my face, and he didn't want to do anything that he couldn't do. That's stupid. so I tend to think that kind of things doesn't work because he's in such an emotional state. He's so hung up on various guilt trips of not doing it and does this make him less of man, that my going ahead and trying to do it; he's just so upset that it's impossible.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He won't let you go ahead and just do it? This is after, you mean, like, in the same way that you've already had a hassle with him just doing it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He knows that when he is just pouring off rage and anger and frustration that it is very, very difficult for me to function around that. It is just awful for me to stand there and comment, pretend he's not slamming doors; and throbbing things; and yelling at the cats; and pushing past me. The climate is not conducive for getting anything done, except for sitting and helping him calm down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got to stop; I want to say one thing, which is that this is our 10th time on this research project so we are kind of half-way through and I don't know what the deal is. Just to say it, I guess, and keep it in mind about what I should do with it. Give you some kind of perspective, I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you want to come again this week or do you want to come next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Ehm, why don't we say next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why don't we say same time next week?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's good; that's great.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, I'll see you next week. 0:57:13.8</p>

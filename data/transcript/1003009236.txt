<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, how are you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Says here you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I'm not very good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm glad I got in because I got here kind of in tears and, just, you know, just not doing very well.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, my husband lost his job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He lost his job?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, I shouldn't say lost the job, but, but he's an Assistant Principal and even though 3A passed in D20, that was in the middle of the override, transferring money from one pot to the other and Assistant Principal job was cut.  So, he's got it until May, but then he has no job and then D11, um, they're closing 9 schools, one of them is mine and so, all of a sudden, I mean I think that, I mean, I don't know.  I'm hoping that, I mean, he can, for me anyway, I'm hoping that I'll have a job because of my bilingual skills -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I'm hoping, but my Principal has not recommended me because I'm, I don't know if you know, psychs are now data point coordinators, we don't really do much testing or working with kids.  We're in there doing little tallies and putting on graphs and statistics and it's just not my, I don't know how to make a graph in Excel to save my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, and that's what I'm supposed to be doing and, even though I wrote a grant I'm doing, have you heard of [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Program assist, motivational drug bully program, but I wrote a grant of $3,000 and I'm working with, I probably see 100 kids a week.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, that's not what they want.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So your school is closing and your Principal is not recommending you for a position?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, as a psych -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe he could give you a letter of recommendation.  Will she write you a letter of recommendation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, I haven't even gotten there yet.  All I did was say, you know, what am I doing, what can I do as a role in my school as a school psych, you know, kind of the chat and we started off on a bad note because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I came in as a psych social worker counselor.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And a lot of my job is finding food and Christmas presents for people and community liaison, well, I don't know the area, I didn't start off on a good foot because I didn't know how to, I mean, I, my husband ended up sending him to Walmart on the [DATE] buying toys and delivering them and he's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> To, to students -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who didn't have any Christmas?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And he's like what kind of job is this, I'm like well I don't have a way to get them toys and I'm down to the wire so he went to Walmart, bought the stuff and took them to the families.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like, I mean, it wasn't, and in my home group, fortunately I called my church and my church donated, you know $100, I mean, but it's sort of what kind of job do you have?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's just not in my training, a school psych, especially new, and like today, I'm trying to hospitalize a kid, he was in [DEIDENTIFIED] last night, and again, I'm just, I mean, I think I did all the right things, I mean I did the suicide assessment, I did the calling of all the DHS, I mean I talked to everybody, but I personally can't get a kid in a hospital as a school psych -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I really don't have that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Authority.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, no but DHS does, and, I don't know, but this kid, whoo, just this kid, again, out of my league, I'm spread too thin, have an IP at 7:00 in the morning and I'm just in tears, I'm just, I have all these data points and I don't really have them so I'm kind of fudging my behavior intervention plan but the pediatrician is going to be there, have you ever heard of [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Heard the name, I don't know him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, so he'll be there and he was really nice to me on the phone, so, but yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's probably stress.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But with a mental health diagnosis, I can't figure what the function behavior is, the function of behavior is a mental health diagnosis.  But that's not an option.  [LAUGHING].  Like is it to avoid work, get attention, this kid's a mess.  Anyway, the doctor was so nice to me, so I'm hoping he'll be there, the behavior specialist will be there, but there's going to be like 15 people there looking at me and, yeah, so yeah, high stress.  [NAME OTHER] lost his job, not lost it but he's miserably depressed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So what's he going to do for next year, does he know, are there other positions open?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, well teaching, he doesn't want to teach, but he's [AGE] and he's just like my career is ruined and the worst part is he's blaming me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you moved back here?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  No -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But he didn't have a job out there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he worked in the jewelry business, he had a job, no because I moved him to California, he had a good job -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, at [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah and then I moved -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Can't he back into [DEIDENTIFIED]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, he's there, he's an Assistant Principal, but he doesn't teach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, that's where he is now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, he is now.  He got a new job there, they're cutting it because of funding.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.  So his job would have been cut anyway even if you hadn't moved here, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no, before he was, he was, he was a DOIP, but he was a Director of Instructional Philosophy, which is a perfect job for him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I made him leave that to California, came back, of course he'd been replaced, he got the Assistant Principal job, and now he's losing it, so game is over, he doesn't want to teach -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What's he want to do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He has no idea, he doesn't know, and so he's depressed and, of course, I mentioned going to counseling and that's all you ever, you know, that's all you ever suggest, he's just depressed.  Mostly he just wants me to listen to him, but you know, first he doesn't want to tell anybody, finally he said tell people so the family knows, but my sister, who makes $200,000 a year lost her job last Friday, and she's going through a divorce, going to lose her house, and so she's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What kind of work does she do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> She's an attorney of real estate, commercial real estate in [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But $200,000 into zero, you know, with a divorce and the guy is, her ex has got some, something, bipolar or some kind of something undealt with and anyway -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the stress level is through the roof.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and, and for some reason, you know, unbeknownst to me, I've read text books before, because I'm taking my medication every other day rather than every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, just because you're forgetting or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because, you know, I'm doing better, I don't know.  [LAUGHING].  I've read the same text books you have, you know like, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I haven't heard of that strategic strategy before, skipping every other day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, no, you've heard of people just stopping to take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, yes, I've heard of that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, anyway, a part of it is, I don't know, I feel like I'm running out, I keep losing it, I lost the 90 day supply, but I called them and lied, the people at, they're going to see me on your tape.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, you'll be safe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway, I called them and lied and said I never got it so they sent me a new one.  Well, they never did -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You just call and tell them you lost it, they should send you another one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, really?  Well, I didn't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, you know, so you don't have to worry about it, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Anyway they sent me another one, and I think I'm out of the Lexapro and the Lexapro is not helping me at all and I told [NAME OTHER] about Lexapro is supposed to help like the sex life, and she's like still a SSRI it's not going to help you any.  It's not helped any -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So it's not -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, in fact it made it worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's supposed less to be less if you have a problem with Zoloft, don't, but it's not?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you have no desire, still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's worse, worse, I mean, now it's worse, there was a time when, well, when my husband needs it most, yeah, I'm completely, I mean a part of this, I'm stressed and I'm tired.  I come home from work and my husband, you know, by the time you make dinner, and then my husband reads to the kids, he definitely reads to them until they fall asleep, he's a pretty boring reader.  No, I'm just kidding.  You know he's reading these classics to the children and I'm out, and it's 8:30, I put the kids down and [NAME OTHER] goes to bed at 8:30 and I'm just cooked, I'm asleep and I haven't done laundry and I haven't done -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, so, so you're going to sleep at 8:30 or 9:00?  And what time do you get up?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I have to be at work at 7:30, 5:30.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you're getting 8 hours, about.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you're still, are you tired during the day still?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or is your energy okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I am tired, by the time I get home, I'm supposed to do an exercise program and I'm like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you eating okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, yeah, a lot of like, sweets, and horrible, I'll eat chips and ice cream for dinner because, because my kids are eating fish sticks and corn dogs, I don't like any of that, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your weight, is it stable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much, did you check lately to see how much you weigh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, I'm too fat, I'm overweight, I'm obese.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, you're not obese.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm just overweight.  And I, um, you know I did a diet thing, Isogenics, but then I get too hungry, I mean I feel like at about 10:00 in the morning I'm going to pass out, you know I feel that like, like my stomach, I mean, like I'm going to throw up, if I don't eat something -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I'm, I'm hypoglycemic, too, and so, you know, I'm supposed to snack, but you're on the run and, I should take a blender to work to make the shakes, but I can't find the shake.  I bought like 4 boxes of it somewhere and I can't find any.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, but yeah, I mean, I, um, I eat fine, I just, I'm a stress eater when I get home.  And then drinking a lot.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Of alcohol?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How much, on average?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, well, I really shouldn't say a lot, but over Christmas was ridiculous, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What about now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Probably I shouldn't say a lot, but, you know, for me a lot, I mean usually like weekends, I'll have a glass of wine, but I mean I'm pretty much -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A glass?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean weekends, you know like Friday night, Saturday I might have a couple glasses of wine, but, you know over the weekend, but actually I've been pretty good the past 3 or 4 days, but after Christmas, I mean, I was coming home and drinking a couple of glasses, like 2 glasses of wine -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A night.  But that's a lot, that's a lot for me, because I don't have a real high, I mean, it's just a lot for me and of course, it makes you tired.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, so I guess, I guess it's not horrible, terrible, but probably for the medication it is, though.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's not good to mix those.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's not good.  I mean, like a little bit isn't going to kill me, right, on the weekend?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A little bit won't kill you but you just want to be careful because of your liver and all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How's your concentration or focus?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, uh, um, I, you know, I've just feel so overwhelmed, again I -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Still scattered?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And just disorganized, I mean that's the biggest problem, but you know, 3 schools, I've got 6 tests, I've got major kids and I can't figure out where anything is and, even though we've moved into a new house, I don't have, I haven't, I just got a file cabinet at one of my jobs, this week, I mean, and I've been there since August, so I can't, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's pretty, pretty -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm not really sure that's ADD or if that's circumstantial, it's hard to know, I can concentrate, I mean I can sit through a 4 hour meeting and listen, so I'm not like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> People next to me are like making decorations with candy and talking and carrying up a storm and I'm looking at them like can you pay attention, I mean, they're teachers, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, so I mean comparatively, to people that I see with ADD, so I don't know, but I do, um, the main, the probably main is the main problem, I just get it hit, you know, I'm more that oh, oh, oh, agitated with kids and my husband, it's like get on your spin cycle, stop, my, my son couldn't find his backpack so I went running in the house, looking everywhere for the backpack and then stuff just a bunch of stuff fell on my head when I was trying to look in the closet and he's like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you get real -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Relax, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Physically, kind of hyper.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, like I got to find the backpack, he's like, okay, your winding everybody up, just relax, we'll find the backpack later, well you running in here tearing things apart, I mean, stuff wouldn't fall on my head if I hadn't like started like peeling everything out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, are you getting racing thoughts?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, not like I used to.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, it's all comparit, you know -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Comparative or [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> When you've been, yeah, sort of, when you've been suicidal for a long time and have racing thoughts, it's like well, you know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So like, are you getting suicidal thoughts now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, no, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, so I mean, everything is relative, like from where I've been it's like, oh, no, not like that, I mean I don't feel suicidal, I feel, I feel maxed and stressed and just,  you know, depressed husband and, and, um, you know the kids are doing well, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They're not, they are -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> They're happy and settled in to school?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I may actually take [NAME OTHER], my oldest, to [NAME OTHER], actually, I think.  He just, I mean, he goes through phases, like right now he's fine, but he'll go through phases where he just cries and cries and cries and no reason, he can't tell me why, and he gets, his temper, he gets mad and throws things, he'll start throwing things and stomping around and he was such a happy kid and now, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> He's how old?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Almost [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And cries and then he's okay for a while, but he feels like he doesn't have any friends and, it's because he's trying so hard, we saw that in California too, he was giving people things to try to be his friend and people never call him and he's like super sports, sports, sports, but he's not really that good at it, I mean, he's, he's consistently the best team player and tries and the best encourager -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But he's not the best player and so, you know, he wants professional sport, he wants to be a professional sports player and it's like okay, got to have a -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Back up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, and then, [NAME OTHER]'s really hard on him because he thinks he's lazy with school work but we called his teacher and his teacher says, no, he's said, he's the most hard working and diligent child, he's not, he's not super, um, he's just not really super bright, you, you know?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so I think our expectations, I mean not that we're so brilliant, but our expect, he's got low comprehension -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Critical thinking, I mean, we ask questions as a family that the [AGE] will answer -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Before he will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So he's -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, he's not, uh, I think he's not, I mean, he's not terrible, I mean he came out on [INAUDIBLE] like with a 115 in math, but, like 90 in language -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, he's not learning disabled, he's just lower than -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What 2 teachers would expect of him.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So we're, we're putting that pressure on him and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So anyway, I was thinking about taking him to [NAME OTHER], I'm not really sure if I need, because this week he's doing well, but then he kind of blows out -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, the show I'm thinking about, talking about the [INAUDIBLE], you've never gone above 200 of the Lamictal, have you?  You have, no?  I wonder if we should, do you want to try going higher to see if it will stabilize things more or do you feel like this is a situation, going to ride it out for a while and see how things go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, it would probably help if I took it every day, don't you thing?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, that would be a big help, yes, maybe that's the first place to start.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  I mean, you know, I wouldn't up it if I'm not taking it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's not going to help, right, because you're only taking half the dose.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> For a week and a half, I've taken it every other day.  I don't know what's with me, I know, I feel like I'm, I feel like, I feel like I'm hoarding it, like I'm going to run out, and I hate that feeling of running out, but the Lexapro, I think I've completely run out, or lost it again -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Which is probably, did I get 30 last time?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's what the prescription was for, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, so now I need 90 to send it in -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Or if we're going to go back to Zoloft because now the Lexapro, it doesn't do anything different.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It, it, okay, so in terms of your sex drive isn't any better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yep, yeah.  I don't know, every day I take a Lexapro except today, I didn't take a Lexapro, I just took the Lamictal -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You haven't been taking it every other day like the Lamictal?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I've been taking everything else.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> These research people are going to be like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I'm just thinking -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Am I going to get a letter in the mail from these people?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No.  So, do you want to go back to the Zoloft or do you want to try something different?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think I should probably take it every day is what I think, I think I need more Lexapro, the Lexapro I have been saving because I'm out, so I've been trying to just take it every other day so it will last longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The Lexapro, I thought you said you were taking it every day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I get mixed up.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I don't take anything -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So the Lexapro -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I only take everything, the Lexapro and the Lamictal every other day now because I'm now on myself medicating -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm going to cure myself plan because I've been doing so much better, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, no.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So why don't we try first -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> What do you mean, no, I was doing so much better, you saw the notes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You were doing better, but, that doesn't work if you stop your medicine or don't take it the same way.  What if we try it for a month to get you back on a regular schedule first, every day or as close to it as you can come, and see if that stabilizes things and if it does, terrific problem solved, if it doesn't make changes to try to get you feeling better -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Is that reasonable?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and we talked about, I mean changing, I mean Lamictal that's like, 5, 2004, 5, I mean that's 5 years on the Lamictal.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right and it may still be that it's working, I mean, it may not be enough for you at this point in life with your stress level, but we won't really know that until we get back at a consistent level -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and it's only been this week, I mean it hasn't been forever, it's only been this week, the every other day, but the agitation is high -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, your stress levels gone up, it sounds like just in the last month you, you heard about [NAME OTHER]'s job, you're school going away this week, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's only this week, so the week that all this happens, I'm taking it every other day and part of it, is it forgetfulness, I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Not if it's every other day probably.  It's, if you forget it, you'd forget it almost every day then.  Or you wouldn't, it wouldn't be so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Just every other day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I don't know, I'm just like off kilter and you know when you have a husband who's mad at his wife, I don't know.  It hasn't been this bad, it really, I was okay until today when I realized I'm at work crying.  I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Not overtly, I mean, people didn't see me, but I realized today, man, I can't do this every other day thing, what am I doing, and then I didn't take the Lexapro and I'm out of Lexapro, I think I have 3 left.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, well I can get you some samples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I need a 90 day prescription, if I'm going to stay with it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's try it for now until we see if it works or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I was doing it, and it wasn't, it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I thought you said you were taking it every other day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Only this week.  From the last time you gave it to me, you gave me 30 pills, I took it regularly until this week, this is a bad week, because I'm doing it, but it's not like every other day all the time, it's just been this week, and I told [NAME OTHER] that, too.  She didn't respond because she was responding to the lost your job, lost the job and, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, do you -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But it went from Christmas which is such a high time with family here, it's wonderful time and then the doldrums when everybody left, of being really down, but, but normal, you know, that's pretty normal after a fun, fun time with family and everybody leaves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then to, to every other day, but every other day has only been the last, I don't know, the last 8 days I've taken it 4 times rather than 8, so you can't make that everything, although that doesn't help.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why I'm doing it, it's like, it's like, and I know that I need to take it and I know that messing with it isn't a good idea, it's like, it was just like testing the, testing the water so that I could be done with it, I mean, I think there's a part of me that, you know, I'm doing better, can I taper off, can I just be done with this medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well [PATIENT NAME], the average person with bipolar disorder goes off their meds 7 times before they figure out that doesn't work well and they need to stay on it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They go through what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The average person with bipolar disorder goes off their medicine 7 times before they realize that that doesn't work and they need to stay on it.  That's average.  Some people -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, how many times have it done that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I haven't counted, I'm afraid to.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Too many, because every time you go up, it's going to, first of all you're going to feel crummy, but also the more episodes you go through, the more susceptible you become to episodes in the future and the more severe they can become.  So it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> This is an episode, you count this as an episode?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um, no, not full blown, no, but you're headed in that direction where we don't want you to go I mean because you were doing so well before and now things aren't as good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, right.  Environmentally, too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, some of it's environmental, some of it's probably not taking the medicine so what I would suggest, let's get you back on the medicine, let's get you stabilized for a month and then reassess.  If you want to continue with the Lexapro, you don't have to get a prescription yet until we see if it's going to work.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, but they won't give it to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Who won't give it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Walmart.  The only -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, I'll give you a month's worth of samples.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So you don't have to get a 90 day until we know if it's going to work or not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  Yeah -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Does that sound okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess I could get a 30 day from Medco if I needed to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, let me give you samples so we can find out first if it's going to work -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I don't notice any real difference, but you know, the whole sex thing is just, my husband seems like he's always sick and he's always -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there's been a lot of stress.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know.  And I don't know if it's just my age, and then my period, remember I was supposed to like, didn't you tell me I should double the antidepressant around my period or something?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can, some people who double it, like the week or 2 before their period, to try to help with the PMS symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because PMS is, I'm sorry I think I had my period last week, too, which -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is just getting like, I mean I had all these blood tests done by my doctor, he tested by thyroid, he tested everything and everything came, came up perfect except for like cholesterol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You think ice cream might be one problem.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I have, well, that has more to do with your triglycerides, probably, but -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, anyway, but everything came out fine, he's like no you're fine, you're not premenopausal, you're not, cause, you know, you're not anything except for arthritis in my hands, but that's not rheumatoid, so he said no, you're fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I thought I was just falling apart, so I went in and he said, no, all good -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And so a clean bill of health, just you know, I'm tired, that alarm goes off at 5:40 and I can't even move until 6:00.  My plan was to do like my exercise routine but I pretty much can't get out of bed until, and then I'm rushing everywhere, rushing to work, and, but the weather hasn't been, like the snow, you know, normally that would just put me out, I mean, I don't know, I really like the weather we're having, this is California weather.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The 60s, yeah, those were nice days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was really nice.  But, um, but I'm not like staying at home, like all grouchy about the snow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I work in D11 so by the time I get to work -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a lot better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's no snow, it doesn't  -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's a lot better.  Let me get some samples of Lexapro.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It doesn't, it doesn't phase me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So do you think I should take my son in?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I think you can, I mean if you're worried about him.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's 4 week's worth.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, and this doesn't go above to like 20, right?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It can -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But we need to give it a month at 10 first to see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What it is or isn't doing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> All right, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So let's give this 4 weeks and check back and just see -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why, it's like there's some kind of funny enjoyment about like doubling it, or there's doubling, I mean doubling and subtracting and, what is that, that's called like self medication.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yes it is, yeah, and it's not a good idea because -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's writing, just because I can't do like Excel, you know data points, so I'm going to my own data.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's probably trying to control things you have control over because you feel out of control in other areas of your life right now and it sounds like it's pretty chaotic with the job situations and the stress and particularly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  The kids are doing well, you know, we have our health.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, I mean if we lose our, if we both lose our jobs, we'll lose our house, of course -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But I mean that's pretty much true with everybody across the country -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They probably have, I mean, there's probably, didn't they lay off like 70,000 jobs yesterday?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I didn't hear it, I stopped watching it's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, the news is getting like horrible.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's, it's rough, you know, for a lot of people.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean I'm sure he could teach, he just doesn't want to and I could teach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, a lot of people are having to take any job they can get, I mean, just to hang in there, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I know, yeah, so I think, and [NAME OTHER]'s just run out of faith -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that's the hard thing is -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it's hard times for a lot of folks, I think he needs to just survive through and get through it, things would turn around.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, if he would just teach -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Maybe for a year or 2, the economy picks back up again -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Move back in to what he really loves.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's just too -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's sad, but anyway hopefully I'll have a job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, look okay.  Let's schedule something for 4 weeks, okay?  You want to do -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Don't schedule it, because I don't have my book.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, how about if I pencil it in, you can check and call me if it doesn't work?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You want to do a Thursday or Friday afternoon?  [DATE] or [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Of [DATE] or [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Are you kidding me?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nope.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean that far out?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> A month will be, yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And what's your latest, I have meetings.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Four thirty.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, no I have meetings.  I have meetings Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and the [DATE] is my son's birthday party.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's not good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> We'll go the following week, we've got, well, I've got Friday the [DATE] in 5 weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Want to do that, at 4:30?  Oh, let me double check one thing to make sure, this woman comes every 4 weeks on Friday, let me make sure that's not the week.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You have people that are actually consistent?  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, it doesn't count when I have a job that's crazy, yeah I have to stay after school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The think I've found is that people are very consistent even in their inconsistencies sometimes.  And people, there are people who are always 20 minutes late for their 45 minute appointment consistently, um, or, you know -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They always forget, like me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Always call me to, always call you and you're like -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That the consistency in your inconsistency, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you like charging by the minute every time I call you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Nope, I haven't sent you a bill yet I don't think, for a phone call.  So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I haven't gotten anything, by the way, from your, [NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She's probably waiting to hear from insurance, then, she usually waits to hear from them and then sends you a bill, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let me get you one week of Lexapro because that's 5 weeks out and I don't want you to run out.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I haven't gotten anything so [NAME OTHER] is like, well, we're going to get a big bill.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can call her if you want to talk to her but it's probably just she's waiting for the insurance company.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.  So, and I don't even know how much this cost, I'm just giving you the amount that I used to pay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then, I suppose they'll -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> She'll let you know if it's more or less, or whatever, once she hears back from them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And I don't even know if I was supposed to get a referral or, you know what I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> For [DEIDENTIFIED] you don't need one, is that who your insurance is through now?  I think, [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think, yeah, with them you don't need one.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I noticed if I need like a referral for my kid for speech, I know for speech they need one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But, they don't need, they don't need referrals like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, thanks.  There's a fifth week and the card and if that works, you don't need to call me, if it doesn't work, call me and we'll switch it around, okay?  Find something that works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, the problem is writing it down in the book.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know why that's hard.  People, people carry those palm pilots, but, you know, I'm a month at a glance kind of gal, I can't like do that, the minutes, the day by day -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Every hour, I need to see the month.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, we'll see how it works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay.  I'll write it down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Some people use mirrors, or you know, bathroom mirror, I've had people tell me they do that on their refrigerator with magnets or somewhere where they can see that reminds them, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Or they put alarms in their cell phones and people get very creative.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll just write it down.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good, that works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> There's the plan, thank you, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're welcome, take care, call if you need anything before next month, okay?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, see you later, bye bye.</p>

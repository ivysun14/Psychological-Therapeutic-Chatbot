<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Interview 14. </p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's spring. I am so ... as soon as possible (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Nothing else has changed except the weather?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing's gotten ... I never felt anything getting better. Yeah just everything seems to - even looking out the window the sun on Hotel Burnham. (Sighs) (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I don't know. I was just thinking it's because well probably most of this is three and a half weeks I haven't had any school pressure. Really ... I think that's part of the biggest part of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not having to think about school.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well I'm still here. I'm still going there. And I'm gonna ... I'm in a secure position so - but not having to worry about it at all. Not having to work to maintain my position the last three and a half weeks. I had the vacation and then the first couple of weeks of (inaudible). Yeah. (Inaudible). I had a ... a letter to report for adaptive. It's sort of - they're just remaining me about like I got ten minutes left (inaudible). Even that doesn't bother me ... cause then that just - that sort of what I wanted (inaudible). What I talked to you about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I didn't want to give up my two (inaudible) deferments and take the chance. So I'm getting back but I wanted to - to find out whether or not I was really going to get out it. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And ... I started (inaudible) but that whatever the outcome at least I'm going to know something in a few weeks other than about their answer about the past year and that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. And so it's a relief that you're just going to know. (0:02:46.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know. I don't feel like it bothers me at all. It's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And ... my parents were really accommodating over the vacation because I went home to them and they were really nicer than I can ever remember them being on a vacation. And the grades - my grades didn't come while I was there so there's not a problem with that. And even since then I think - I'm sure they must have gotten a copy of grades but they said nothing and ... which is not like them because I didn't do that well. Last quarter was not taking the French problems (inaudible) and taking an (inaudible) in my other courses. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But they really let up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It seems like it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So since last time for you too or -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. During the week, I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. My father when I talked to him about school and how I was doing - indicated to him that I was definitely going to have to stay over and finish the course ... he didn't even - the thing that seemed to bother him most about me not graduating was in thinking that I might drop out or something like that. That's what's bothering him most. He even seems sort of willing to pay for additional time which is something I hadn't (inaudible) he would be. But that's all ... very hypothetical. I don't want him to have to pay for it. I can pay for it myself because (inaudible) myself when I (inaudible) but.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's - it's nice knowing that it would - it might be there.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That maybe you could depend on them to hold back on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. It - if say I shouldn't be able to get a good job this summer or something like that which I think is probably a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Was that much of a surprise when you - did something so much that you hadn't predicted? I mean you really hadn't thought that he - that he - he worried about you dropping out. You thought he was mainly worried about that you didn't spend an extra quarter and money and - (0:05:37.7)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Had to take a hard to line and he did -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the fact that - the fact that my average is not so fine. That he just wouldn't be very cooperative. But ... he seemed to stress less now. Like he always use to stress to get good grades and good - grades. And ... that's where the stress was and he's seeming more stressed you know complete your work and (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So what do you think of that change?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it just occurred to me now that that's sort of strange because it sort of ... in a way admitting - he's admitting to himself that I've been able to (inaudible) like that. That I have (inaudible) and ... he's lowered his high hopes of me and he's going to be satisfied with something less now ... because I failed so miserably or something like that. </p>

<p>But ... another possibility is that he's beginning to realize that maybe ... maybe it's not just a matter of me - fooling around and not taking school seriously and - not studying when I should. I'm playing around and things like that. Because whenever I seem to do okay any time I complete something. It's just the difficulty I have in completing the (inaudible). Like I show that I have the ability to do the work from a level like because I have (inaudible) but I have the ability but whether or not I can do it. So.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Would it help (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And ... yeah, I don't now. I sort of like to think that that he's actually becoming aware it - that I'm not out there fooling around all the time and that ... I mean I have things on my mind and problems focusing of some sort. But - but that ... make it difficult for me to ... achieve as much as he wants me to do sometimes I think. (0:08:42.1)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. You'd like - you'd like to think that he's giving you the benefit of doubt now. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That he's starting to believe now what I've been telling him for the past - the past two and a half years and (inaudible). And I sort of take it (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If he were changing in that way having to understand you on the terms that you understand yourself, what - that would be a change you'd like (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: He'd be - he'd be starting to ... to - to judge me by my actions - by what I do and judging me about what I say I am rather than what he wants me to be. And what he thinks I should be. You know like the thought - this thing every father wants his son to succeed where he's failed or something like that. He wants his son to do better than he did - to do better and so it seems like now he's (inaudible). He might be sort of realizing that ... it's not really possible always or at least in this case. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd just like to say that up to now anyway he's had these - it seemed to you he always had these expectations for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you had to do those things.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He did.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: He needed you to do those things. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Apparently I missed him. In some ways I still feel like the results of that like if I really feel he steered me towards science as opposed to something in social sciences or ... or ... something profession.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You kind of don't experience those - your own choice.</p>

<p>PATIENT: At the time I think I did. I thought that's what I was doing but now I look back and say well maybe - maybe it wasn't. That they weren't even exercising different social persuasions.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That you got kind of sucked and pushed. (0:11:26.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So I forget where we were. It's kind of goes back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Talking about your father and his change in attitude.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That maybe he's had (inaudible). He had a change in attitude. What was his attitude when (inaudible)?</p>

<p>
PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you lose track because it didn't seem very involved in it or what? You're not real willing now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It seems sort of evolving sometimes to ... I don't know. It just seems to end ... and I didn't know where exactly I'd come from.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you don't know if it had ended because it just kind of stopped with you sometimes coming to the conclusion (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It sort of got ... it's - I've had this feeling or this idea ... and my (inaudible). It started to ... look around it. And ... then it just sort of ... I can't say that it's really complete. Everything like my - my analysis of it except ... it just all of the sudden seems to have ended very suddenly.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Couldn't get any further with it now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I might but ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it didn't seem like it. It didn't seem like it to me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it doesn't seem like it was anything stunting or frustrating exactly but more like it evaporated.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just all of the sudden it (inaudible) for me. I really have ... I don't know whether I should be talking about things like - I don't like talking about the things that bother me the most. But.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't like to do. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Because I feel like I'm harping on the same old things. I don't like to talk about school; don't like to talk about my father. It's just like I keep pumping you with the same old things. I don't - and then just on a superficial level like I'm not really ... thinking any deeper about this. In some ways I feel like I'm (inaudible) fault of my own. I keep on saying the same things over and over and - (0:14:52.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well who does -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just not ... getting to the root of the matter or whatever. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean it's kind of like saying that that same surface place.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And - and is the sense that you're just wearing yourself and getting really impatient with it or is it - is it me as well that you're worried about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think it's primarily ... boring myself and - and feeling that ... it's just not important to me to keep coming around to the same superficial level. Like you may like back over (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And I ... the only way that you come into it is just sort of the - sort of ... and surprised at the way you're seeing enough to lose interest in the (inaudible). Like you don't have (inaudible) said that. You told me that before. Almost as though I was saying things that were slightly different but they're still the same level that I'm (inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that's - is that to say that even if there's slight differences in content, it's all on the same kind of level? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So this is really, really different in the way that it would matter to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You know that ... </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's your sense of staying on that level? You're like not knowing how to get to another place or not being able to try or not being able to or being - waiting for something to change or what goes on when you just say stay on that level?</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's - it's not ... not being able to get to another level and not knowing how to do it. Like I sort of think that - that it's - it's my fault that being into it enough. You know what I mean? Like not being in - really involved in the (inaudible) thinking about it. I keep - I keep on - on being distracted and thinking about ... it's like I'm falling to really concentrate. That's what I - that's what I think is the reason that I'm (inaudible) it. But. (0:17:59.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you see that as your responsibility? Like you could do something about it that if you want to do something about that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I want to - yeah, that I should be concentrating or - or else there's just something strange about the fact that it's not happening automatically. Yeah, because I'm really getting into it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe something's wrong up there? Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. No. Not that there's something wrong up there because now that that part could be something wrong with me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I thought of another alternative ... that might be and I don't know. I'll just see how this fits but maybe these things that you think are involving you are the things that you care about the most. I'm really just suggesting it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To see if it fits - if it fits in somewhere.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's a possibility but ... it's a possibility and when I talk about the weakness, it's not the easiest to talk about and they - my closest most specific problems. I should start like talking and broadening it out just a bit. Yeah the whole (inaudible) you're pathetic, mechanical society that we live in and how that really upsets me and I don't - I really hate the feeling of being this - (inaudible) inconsequential (inaudible) and that's tough to talk about. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's hard to talk about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that feeling's a little (inaudible) than the specific things I keep on going back to. And ... it's not as concrete sort of - it's not as ... concrete.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean it may be like a little bit more involved than that feeling but it's like not as specific what it is or it's easy for them -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's more involved than that. Like it's been going on for years ... and it's not like a specific situations that ... need some sort of resolution now. It's - it's sort of like the ... broad thing that I have to deal with ... for the rest of my life ... pretty much. (0:20:58.6)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't see it as any kind of immediate pressure? I mean it doesn't seem like we should talk about it. I mean it's (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) or you don't (inaudible) as an immediate pressure. No. It's just something that's always on your back. It's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I see. So maybe there's not as much push to talk about it but - about it in a way. Like you don't notice it every day you're carrying it around -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You carried it around for so long that ...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well you don't - you don't notice it but ... and you don't notice it getting any heavier but it's just like what did they say - like somebody could start off like that. I think it's ... some sort of mythology about some guy who picked up a baby calf that weighed like 10 pounds and then five miles with it - every day he ran five miles with this baby calf. You know like in a couple years it was a full grown folly but still he ran five miles with it a day. </p>

<p>And it's sort of the same thing but ... it's like every day this ... like this feeling gets a little heavier on me or something but you just sort of don't notice the difference over two days or a week or something. But at the end of two years, you really realize that maybe you are carrying around quite a weight with you. But it wasn't there a few years ago.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And is that what it's like now? (Inaudible) really grown.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's - it's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or is it more than just it's gone.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well - It's grown compared to when I first came to New York and ... and I also know that it's going to keep on being that and keep on growing - still being part of the world and.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There's no way of keeping it down to size?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't given much thought to that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't given much thought to that. And - and knowing that - that every day goes on ... it gets a little - a little heavier.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's kind of what I mean and angry to you. You haven't thought about those things and in (inaudible) it kind of seems explicitly that it's not growing. It's just an (inaudible) that's going to keep on. There isn't even a way to contain it. Know what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. I haven't even thought about a way to contain it or dump it but ... but it's - it's still ... it's still there. (0:24:08.2)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's almost like now it's just a fact of your life that way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But ... I mean the future is going to be more and more unbearable I think unless - unless I deal with it in some way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. It sounds like you really accept (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I really -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like maybe you feel like you can't be anything else but that. Okay, it's there but it's in no way a good thing for you. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't think it's a good thing for me at all and ... at the moment I feel there's nothing I can do about it. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's it like just to - to (inaudible) that thing that's growing and growing and (inaudible) growing more and more and more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't see a point ... in going through life. It's just growing out of my shoulders. That ... I don't see any reason like in being this little thing (inaudible). There's just no reason to exist. It's just - if that's all of meaning there is to me is just being so (inaudible) for another 60 years or something. I just don't see the point of it because even though I am (inaudible) feel the weight on my shoulders from life and all its problems. And you know other people say just ... you know such an (inaudible) part of something (inaudible). It's not worth it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems -</p>

<p>PATIENT: All of the trouble.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Seems like all that time you - you don't matter. You just don't matter. (0:26:15.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Also I just don't matter and there's just nothing to look forward to and ... there's no reason to keep on carrying this weight. Yeah. I don't know. It's ...like - what I'd like to say meaningless. You know being - I don't know. When you (inaudible) read the paper or listen to the news or something, you hear about all these people that are (inaudible) the Senators, the rich people and stuff like that and - and you don't consider them (inaudible) and you always just sort of by hearing their names and hearing what they've done, you sort of get the - more or less intimate knowledge of them. </p>

<p>And you sort of figure that - that they're people too and that they're equal - you're equal to them. Hearing about them and reading about them in the paper and judging them just sort of gives me this feeling of - of being ... very much their equal. And then - and then realizing that I'm not and I don't count at all. It's - it's kind of ... a disappointment afterwards after what I've been thinking.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You get into thinking one way which is well you're kind of on a level with them in a way you have some kind of power over them and you can judge them. Your power is equal to theirs.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well - it's not power. It's just ... they are very important people and I hear a lot about them. They're important to them. The most important person in my life is me and so we're all important together. And then ... and like running into them on the street and right away you know that you're this nothing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are just nothing or you just think you're nothing?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You're inconsequential.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Of what? What are you saying? (0:29:01.8)</p>

<p>PATIENT: As far as ... as far as they're concerned I'm nothing and as far as the functioning of the world goes, I'm nothing. Where as they are -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: They have power and control of say anything. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's mainly that shift that's - that's really disturbing to you. Right or is it kind of ease and niceness saying oh, we're all important? (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And then (snaps fingers) all of the sudden it almost seems like that's not true anymore. What's happens to ... you wake up - it's like wake up and realize that. What's it like?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I won't admit to myself that I'm any less important than Richard Nixon. I'm not going to say he's more important than me but everyone else thinks so. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're holding onto that. You're holding onto you can as much as him. But you're very alone in that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah I am.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like you're the only one who thinks that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well then it's certain people you get very close to can also think that too. You know so you don't seem exactly entirely alone in being (inaudible) against you and that stuffs important.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But ... I don't know. It's just unsettling. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like having a rug pulled out from under you ... kind of thing. But you know like really a jolt - jumping out from the - where you're thinking and everything. Look at me. How are you thinking - thinking about that as it comes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's just trying to think - last night ... I worked (inaudible) and they're only ... important people. The VP and all of the vice president and I think like the Donnellys and the Presgars (ph) and all of these people are and you're going to the same room with them there and they're talking on the phones and there's people. And you listen to them talk and they talk just like you. I mean its words and they eat food. (0:31:58.4)</p>

<p>And just that they - with the other waiters and they make jokes about these people out there. How they (inaudible) this and that and you're just ... you really get this feeling of being just as important as them. And then ... like coming out of there and - and you can sort of ... like you know you're not as important as them because if you wanted to there's no way you could talk to these people. Like right now if I wanted to call up (inaudible) Donnelly, there's just no way in the world I could talk him, right? You know like there's all these people between him and me who are going to say you're not important enough to talk to him at this time. (Inaudible). And.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just kind of envisioning how that door would just keep on being closed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't - I don't expect that the ... that he doesn't - I wouldn't except that any person is too busy to have to time for some other person.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible). When you say you don't except it you mean you just don't think that's a legist or you don't think it's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't think that ...that's legitimate at all. And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you just don't think it's -</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some ways I can't believe that that if you actually got through to all of these secretaries and stuff whose job it is to - to keep him from - away from everybody and keep everybody away from him. I always have this feeling that if it were just the two of us in the room, I'd be just as important. And he'd be just as important to me as I would be to him because then we are (inaudible). And ... occupying each other's times (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you could once get through - not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well no. Not really. But ... I don't know. Just - just knowing the whole ... just sort of feeling like a non - a non entity in the society where there actually are people who are something and they should be with the system. There's - (0:35:01.8) </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) Especially like I don't know. When you're a kid, you always think of yourself is absolutely the only thing - at least I did. You know the whole world revolves around me. And now it's still turning around and I'm starting to revolve around these other things that have control over me. And ... it's - it's hard to get - to get use to that idea like probably - I probably haven't. Probably I you know the moment (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you rebel against having to agree to that idea. Be damned if you have to get use to that. You don't really believe it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I don't think I can change it. Okay, (inaudible) I'm looking for some way to live outside of this. And ... I don't know. That's not easy to do unless you tried. You know like in my mind I keep on thinking hypothetical ways as opposed or I'll just have this vision of me being a free individual that's free within this big system and ... just functioning freely within. But I really don't know how to go about becoming that and the only way to do it is almost by trying things but I'm actually not. I'm not trying things. I just go and going around doing other things (inaudible) the passion and ... fitting right in the groove sort of like I'm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And watching yourself do that, how does that feel to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I keep on thinking that the longer I stay in it the harder it is - going to be to get out of it. And as it is I don't think I have ... not only do I think I don't have the courage or whatever it takes to pop out of it now but I don't even have a good idea of what I should do ... in order to be a free spirit or whatever. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't know how to get there and you don't know what it is that you're trying to get to.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So as it is you keep on seeing yourself do is (inaudible). You know or stay in that groove and get yourself deeper and deeper into it and then it's just like starring and - (0:38:02.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Where it leaves me and then I'll be in more and more and more. You know the more I'm doing it the less I know where I am. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you just keep losing yourself more and more.</p>

<p>PATIENT: To this - to this big system where I get more and more ... socialized (inaudible). Kind of like right now I have this feeling ... this image of me (inaudible) as soon as I get (inaudible), I'm going to start packing my bags and then I can put - something over my shoulder (inaudible) something. And (inaudible) do it for, I figured there'd be 10 years behind us or something and we still have a little bit of time. Actually I don't even think it was in terms of time. I think it was in terms of forever. </p>

<p>That - that the United States you know top technological and scientific and there's no place else on Earth that - that is to the degree what we are. And ... and all of these other countries have been seeing what's happened here, won't let their selves turn into the same sort of (inaudible). So that's how I sort of see myself getting out of it whether or not I do do it, (inaudible) get out of it by doing it. It remains to be seen. But.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you've got some - some reservations about the alternative. I mean whether - at least about whether it's going to work - it would work you think if you do do it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you have some reservations about whether you're actually going to go ahead and (inaudible) out of that (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And - and how much is that (inaudible) to doing things now ... to keep me from trying now. You know it's like saying I'm going to hop onto the groove when I get to the next fork in the road. That's - that's what I'm sort of thinking so there's no point in trying to hop out of it now. I'll just wait until then. That fork in the road or something else. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that makes you worry that you're - that you're doing what? (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: That - that I'm just fooling myself. That when I do get to the fork in the road I'm not going to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Then what's - then what's not - what putting it off means is that you aren't willing to do it now and you won't be willing to do it then either. If you aren't willing to try to jump out of that groove now that means that when you were you think maybe that means you aren't - (0:41:02.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're always going to be afraid to jump out of that groove. What's scary about jumping out of that groove?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) and all of those places and you know see about alcoholics and very poor people with bottles and stuff like that. That's pretty much what happened to them. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you see them as having tried to jump out of that groove and all that happened to them -</p>

<p>PATIENT: In some way or another they didn't go along and just sort of got mowed out by the way side and ... unless - unless you have a pretty good idea of what you wanted to do ... it's -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's hard to see how the same thing won't happen to me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean like if you just drift even for a little while what's going to happen is that you're going to get pushed over towards that kind of - the destroyed life.</p>

<p>PATIENT: If you - yeah, if you drift for a little while you just get passed over. You won't be able to get back on where you got off. And - and you might end - by then it might be too late and in replace you just keep on slipping back down.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Down into what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Some of the poverty or whatever. You know how - I just would consider it unhappiness if I had to be - for a profound unhappiness to bums and things like that. Maybe they're not. They might have just ... when I see them I just (inaudible). They (inaudible) very sad. They have a lot of things they want and need and can't - no way to get them and they can't do less than I do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're really closed off and I mean you're really - you're afraid that you'll just get closed out like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: More than - more than I am now. Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. Well you can have the little bits that you have now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I mean I do something ... I'm afraid that I might do the wrong thing and so I want to have some sort of vision so that if I do do the wrong thing, I'll be able to pretend like nothing happened and go right on with (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's kind of like always having a real fit - place where you can pull yourself - like if you jump off - (0:44:02.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have a rope so you can pull yourself back in case -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Anything (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I never started to (inaudible) and if -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't mean as much to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well it's tending to move away from that. I think it's all been real lonely since ... I don't know. Maybe - maybe it's just because of (inaudible) deeper level. Like deeper levels than (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think that when I talk about something for a certain length of time it's (inaudible) things about it. I sort of lose interest in it or I don't need - (inaudible) what I said is right. There's no need to go further.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's what's happened in this thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what started happening. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're implying that it's a simple function of time spent talking. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that what it seems?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. Things that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: A number of things said.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Once I say something I don't like to retract it or modify it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How come?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I always think I'm right so. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't think it needs to be changed. (0:45:51.6)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that's hard to say right now but what I think ... is it - it may need to be changed if the situation changes. It seems to me that whenever I - cause I (inaudible) the situation and people ... I make (inaudible) to come to some conclusions and I believe that my conclusions are right but I think that more than just like thinking I'm correct because I say it. </p>

<p>And that's the best I can do. I think that that's what I said is ... the best that can be said under the circumstances about the situation and at times I worry about that. Because you know the fact that (inaudible) what's going to happen if - if you're wrong. How come - how come you're always right and ... I just worry about that? Do you know what I mean? (Inaudible) but you know. I can't believe it when I say something ... more than just (inaudible) to me. </p>

<p>That it generally doesn't move - multiplication because I understood the things that everybody (inaudible) and (coughs). Right now I can't - it's sort of like I know I can't be as bright as I feel I am ... and I don't know what to do about that but like if I - if we're talking about something and I say a lot of things about ... eventually I get to the point where I think ... that I've said taken together constitutes a complete picture of the situation. Anything more that I say is either going to be redundant or ... if I (inaudible) could be some what contradictory. I don't know. Maybe I'm afraid of some things I turn in ... turn out to be contradictory of what I said. (0:48:42.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like once you've got that picture there you don't want to do any - you don't want to risk having to change it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well yeah but it's like ... not handling - well having to change it and saying that -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Getting another thing in there that's worth the (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah or going over it again and then - you've done a picture and you believe that it's the right - true and then you're going over it again and like going over all the colors again and it - feels like another coat - a blue one over a red one. Like I say (inaudible) the first time.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't seem like a very bad thing. Is that it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I tend to put more belief in the first thing then the second.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't want -</p>

<p>PATIENT: The second is just ... some kind of confusion or lazy mistake. I say to myself well -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just look -</p>

<p>PATIENT: You've been through it once now you're just being careless and being hassled and stuff like that. Being slipped up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you're mad at yourself. No.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Probably in back ... (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible) embarrassed.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well having made a mistake so it's something that I should know. I mean like pretend to have the right answer for it all of the time. It bothers me how come everything seems so simple to me now. It's like why now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's like lots of times you kind of feel you do so there's that to say - to say when you've completed (inaudible) or something and it seems to you like you have - that that's a sense of satisfaction. Like I'm right, I am someone. Yeah or saying yeah, that's it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: And there's no more to it because I don't have anything more to say about it and there couldn't be anything more to it because I don't think I can (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But it's a kind of a sense of satisfaction with that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't think I've ever really noticed satisfaction but the feeling is sort of like a -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (Inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Kin to satisfaction I guess. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Satisfaction that's probably the first thing I can -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah but it isn't really exactly - doesn't really exactly fit in - (0:51:41.2)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is it more like kind of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: I've never noticed a satisfaction but now I can think of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like saying it's worth the satisfaction.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what you're noticing it as is something more like looking at the things way out there and saying yeah kind of -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's done.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Proven.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just like.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I never did that before. Yeah if I could finish here knowing (inaudible) or something.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And you kind of say to yourself oh, okay. Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible) if I can't take the chance on getting things (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh. Is that like saying a little bit of attention? That you better not go back to it - not get scrambled up.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Better get involved in something else right away and not look at this picture any longer - not see something - like it needs your attention.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah that I'm going to make a mistake and ruin the whole thing. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Things might not seem so clear to you again and again.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I - well if I - if I look back over and say something was different from what I said the first time, then ... I'd have to decide which of the two was right. </p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: And -</p>

<p>PATIENT: And - in any event, something I said would have been wrong and ... the whole idea of that is unacceptable. I don't know. Sometimes I get ... well, I get pleasure out of - out of realizing ... sort of like my approach to something was wrong. Like I get pleasure out of - out of correcting myself and saying well now things are going to be better. And it's not really your own fault that all of the (inaudible) and labor are going to be false assumption. So sometimes when I - when I correct myself I look at it as things are going to be better and I like it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think you understand this whole -?</p>

<p>PATIENT: But - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Or like - (0:54:17.5)</p>

<p>PATIENT: We're making progress. I don't know or why I tried to get a - I don't know. (Inaudible). When I talk to someone and if we talked about it to every person or something instead of pushing it down ... or a strange or someone and you can ... more times than not I come to some sort of definite conclusion that I really put a lot of stock into my (inaudible) I think and it ... I don't know. </p>

<p>Like - right now I'm just starting to feel really bothered about ... how come I'm always right? How come I have all the answers? In a way that's another - it's another sort of like questioning my own words and my own values. I've always had a lot of values as being like a source of right depth. (Inaudible) this is -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: This idea of maybe you're wrong sometimes.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Threatens to make you (inaudible). Threatens to make you more of a - smaller little plan.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it tends to make me more like everybody.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that -</p>

<p>PATIENT: It tends to make me more like all the (inaudible) people I see around - like most of the people are (inaudible) or describe to me the media intelligence or stupidity somewhere along too. And ... it's - it sort of drags me down from - from this by - I just do it myself and I won't because it's more average and being average and I've always been brought up to believe this is have a great crime.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's a crime. What's the crime then? (0:57:05.0)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being average. Being just like a bunch of people on the streets.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Something that horrible that but I can see a lot of (inaudible). It could be but it's not clear for you. You're just like everyone else is all (inaudible).</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I'm trying to think of (inaudible) turn out to be average everything.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Have you told (inaudible)?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It - that sort of doesn't have any meaning to it to be average. Like when - when I was talking before about ...you know I'd be important to different people (inaudible). People with some sort of clout. They - they are not average. I don't consider them average. And I don't think of myself as average but then ... the more average I become the more like everybody else. You know? Like.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean how special you are?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Sort of. The less equal to them I am the more ... the more equal to all of the other people (inaudible) around here and the people downtown in the stores and everything. I'm trying - I'm trying to think right now like what exactly it is about being average. That I thought - it was something that was - that bothered me about being average. And I decided it's time to (inaudible) because it seemed like. You know even if I was average in this one aspect or something like that, I still won't take myself - I'm really not. That's just one thing and not really average.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean you're not so clear that it's - a lump category.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Like -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You are or you aren't. You are on one thing and - (0:59:42.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Just in one thing average doesn't mean I'm entirely average. I'm trying think - what was is? What I related to it. It probably had something to do with school or for - I don't know. I think it did. I don't know. No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Just lost it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I haven't like ... it might have had something to do with being average is only relative because you can be average here and you can be above average here somewhere else. And I could be below average (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What if it is a criteria like that? I mean what if you saw it as that, does that make a difference in your view of it you think?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well ... it's somehow takes away some of the - the equalness of the effort. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like it doesn't dump you in one - one sweep.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Even thought of being an average student who (inaudible) by the rule. Well a C is considered average for something that's (inaudible) I think. The thought of doing ... just C average work ... bothers me. It would also bother me to have the average - grade point average because the average grade point - 2.6 or something like that, it would bother me to have that. I want to feel better. I want to feel better than other people. I want to have the highest grade point average. (1:02:53.0)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being at that average means being the same as other people too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Not being better than them or stronger than them but having not (inaudible). It just the same. It's like a basic identity. I think we gain identity by being below average but I don't think that's ... if you want to be better than someone I think. It's the whole idea of - that I've been so (inaudible) with is you're only worth's now good you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're only worth your relative standing on that - ladder.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Sort of. If you're really worthwhile you'll be - I mean if you're really good, you'll be worth (inaudible) being poor and you'll be -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You only mean something like this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You'll be meaningful. Yeah. But if - if you're just average, you're not worth much. Any average person ... can sweep floors and get paid $50 a week - something like that. Yeah being the - being average is sort of you get the feeling that you're penalized, right, in the society. The rewards go to - </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: People who are above average.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: If you're just average, you won't get anything. In fact you won't get -</p>

<p>PATIENT: You won't get enough to -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Stomped down.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You won't get enough to ... to - to be able to enjoy things. You'll always be too busy trying to save or scrap together enough - something like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Being average means just having to keep afloat - just by (inaudible). </p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean this kind of struggling and getting along. Not being able to let out -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Being average is more like this - being less great and ... the more average you are the more you're condemned to being part (inaudible) and so. Like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Kind of came to something.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. (Inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I've got to stop. So you got to figure out what to do with that ... schedule then. (1:05:55.3)</p>

<p>PATIENT: On Monday, Wednesday and Friday ... I'm free from 10:30 on.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All day?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All day.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And on Tuesday and Thursday, it's kind of patchy.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. How's about ... 3:00 p.m. on Monday and I'll do your bunch.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Two thirty on Wednesday. 3:00 p.m. is better. 2:45 p.m. Wednesday. </p>

<p>PATIENT: What time on Monday did you say?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Three.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Three.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Four on Tuesday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You don't have (inaudible) - you don't have that - you have that French class I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. So we (inaudible). We could - the best time for me. Well 10:30 a.m. on Thursday (inaudible). 3:00 p.m. on Mondays, 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, 2:45 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday. (Inaudible). 10:30 a.m. on Thursday and I can't think of any more times right off the bat but -</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Well - 3 o'clock on Monday is fine and Tuesday time I have a class so Wednesday ... four is okay. Thursday is intriguing because I get it - should be out of French at 10:30 a.m. but now I have an 11:30 a.m. to (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's intriguing about that? (1:08:21.4)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I like to get to the class early so I can a seat there. They're close together. It's a large class.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it's not such a hot time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. It might not be but it's intriguing because it was (inaudible) filling the hour because I just -</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well you know what we could do is, we could try it one week. We could try it this next week. It's not as intriguing as a scheduling thing and otherwise doesn't seem like much of any.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. It is then. Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How about - how about 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday? Would that be a problem (inaudible)?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. Fine. That's good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It was intriguing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It was - this is the way you call it - this driving a perfect schedule I mean.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (Inaudible). I don't know. The way I've been going to (inaudible) so far this quarter we probably could have scheduled it in the morning. Just the last quarter but (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Once we get (inaudible). Do you want a slip for yourself?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No thanks. I think I'll (inaudible).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Was there something made for today?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Yeah I thought so. Three o'clock Monday, 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>

<p>
COUNSELOR: Right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The next day is?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Friday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Friday. Alright I'll see you Monday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alright. Bye.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Bye. </p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:

</p><p>We'll start the tape. Number 111, client number 0426002, interview 9, side 1, track A. That's right. Tape number 111, client 0426002 hype (ph), interview 9, track 1, side A. And what do you... (inaudible at 0:33) (Background conversation/noise)

</p><p>PATIENT: It would be nice to have a replay of that last tape.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't.

</p><p>PATIENT: Just to find out where I was, you know (inaudible at 1:02) and I realized I'd have to write them down or (inaudible) then I didn't write them down and (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Are you (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I must of thought about. I mean when I was just (ph) (pause), I think I decided I hated men (ph) (inaudible at 1:26) (laughter) and I really, not really in [hate say] (ph) but I don't have great respect for, but then I don't have a great for women either. And I suppose that if you don't like yourself then you can't like anybody else. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would say to become a good person (inaudible at 1:54) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I, you know, maybe you can respect me in another way because when it comes to sex I just can't, because like when I first started dating and I like all way through dating it - all I was trying was to see if I could turn him on. And it was so easy.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Okay.

</p><p>PATIENT: And after that ewww, you know. I didn't - like they have control over themselves (inaudible at 2:18) (laughter).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. You know if you were really, you know (inaudible) they would sort of give him, I don't know exactly, but you've heard (inaudible) and they didn't know if (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (cross talk) like when it's, yes it really too bad they didn't, you know, or like somebody didn't have control over them. But nobody ever had. You know, and I think that's what I'm used to (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Well, (inaudible at 2:46) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) so no man (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: And then now we did. And it's not always that, it's just men, like on my way over here I must see, you know, ten men and like they're always go - all of the black men say something. And the white men just go along. Because you know I'd just like to strangle these guys. (different voice) "Well hello there." (laughter) I'd like to poke them in the eye.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Makes me curious (ph) 

</p><p>PATIENT: It really does. I know you're supposed to feel flattered, you know, that somebody will whistle at you or say (different voice) "Well hello there." (laughter), I'd just like to hit him. It's (pause), it's just like, you know, that's all you are, is a sex object, always, for everyone, even strangers. They don't think of you as anything else. Not even as a person. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All you are is your body.

</p><p>PATIENT: (inaudible at 3:50) I mean that doesn't even have to be a decent body, (laughter) just any old body. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Is that (inaudible) absurd (ph) you know, we'll do. And I think that men don't have any, they really don't have pain (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Probably. (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean you'd...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: No. Anybody could walk by. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) along with much of anything else.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. (pause) And I think maybe that whether these people would prefer that you didn't have anything else. And I think that about Jim sometimes too. You know that if you really didn't have driving (ph) it might be easier, for him. It really, it just, men turn me off. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 5:09) 

</p><p>PATIENT: But you know, like, I don't like, like men that don't care for me, I don't like them either. I mean I like to flirt. But that's, but that would be among friends. To be friendly, people call that flirting.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that doesn't says you like to be, someone you like be (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right and then on the other hand I don't

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 5:45)

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I don't know what I mean. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's, it's, you want to be a woman only so far. You know, but if they get, start getting ideas.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: And then that's over.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But if you liked them, you'd like to turn their heads, you don't want our ears (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) Turn empty heads (laughter).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And then if they get, start getting (inaudible) then turn off like that (snaps)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (pause), (shifts in chair), (pause) Maybe I run into too man that just, that you don't even have to smile and they're touching you. You're just sitting there minding your own business.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 7:00)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean weren't even too cool about it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, thinking back over the years (laughter). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: You know like how you go on a date with this guy I really thought was neat and he was trying to do was to get my straps down off of my dress. And before that time I thought he was a nice guy. A little conceited, but we all have our hang-ups and I just, it really infuriated me that that's all he wanted to do. You know, spend your whole evening getting the straps down. Now I don't know what he was going to do after that, but it was sort of like an obstacle course or something (laughter), after you get that done, then you go onto something else. And it really aggravated me. 

</p><p>And the guys I dated in college, all they wanted to do was to get into your pants. That's all they wanted. And there was hardly any (pause) preliminaries, so to speak. I mean, at first, you know when you first started dating him it all right and then after that (pause) they didn't waste any time or any money or anything but he wanted to get.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 8:22) I get the image that you, I mean sometimes (inaudible) batting their hands away from you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I did - I never did that. I, you know, like I think I had good cause, but I've never had the nerve to hit anybody for getting fresh.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Because I was always afraid they might hit me back (laughter), as a matter of fact. You know, and it - and I...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You didn't have any concerns about them.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, I was rude (ph), really because I didn't have the nerve to strike them. You know, and it was just always protecting yourself with you hands all over. And...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it was kind of like (inaudible at 9:05) 

</p><p>PATIENT: But, and you know like you think go out on a date and then they, you know, I mean, invade (ph) these things, like that they've bought you. Your time for the rest of the evening, you know if they take to a show. Okay, so they spent 2.50 on you and they want to get 2.50's worth back. And I don't really, you know, it always seems like that to me. But I don't really know if that's what - I mean, surely that's not what they're all thinking.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But that's, this, is what you feel (ph).

</p><p>PATIENT: That's what I feel. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now I've got various insight into put out to (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And you're in trouble if go to a play (laughter) or something. That's a lot of money. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: All right. You've heard me talk about (inaudible) that's a lot more of you than you want to hear.

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: And they can be so expended. I mean, you know, if everything didn't go their way. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What would that do to you?

</p><p>PATIENT: It made mad. (pause) Even if they were kind of dumb they would come back and try it again. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. Well I mean (inaudible). 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So whatever you did didn't matter, really.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I didn't believe it anyway. Well (pause), yes, I guess that's what I think of it. And I still do, like, like, Jim, if he's decent to me, it's like he's bought me and now it's time to put out. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 11:01) in the same way that you knew then to be on your guard for (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: I just can't think that they would be nice to me, or anybody would be nice to me just because they're nice people and like to be nice, you know. It's always got to be some payment. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I was raised (inaudible at 11:38)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. And it does (laughter) you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So it's not just in your own mind, this was a task to be...

</p><p>PATIENT: But I mean I shouldn't think of sex as being payment after we're married. I mean he's supposed to be nice to me, but we're also supposed to go to bed together. That's written some place I'm sure. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) yes, it does sound like it is payment to me. It sounds like it's your obligation. His payment is to be decent (ph) to be nice to you, that's written there. And you obligation is to go to bed with him.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But I'm not holding up my end of the bargain. (pause) And I, you know what, I just can't. I just don't even want to. (pause) And like occasionally it's all right. (pause) It was like I said last night, it's just, you know, for six years he'd let me go and I could read a book at night and I didn't - and nobody was coming in to get me. (laughter) It's like some evil person, you know.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's what it seems like?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. It does, you know, like you here these steps coming and you think, here he comes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 13:02)

</p><p>PATIENT: And now, in the past two months he's decided that he's going to have intercourse whether, whether it's good or not. You know, so that he doesn't feel, you know, like he isn't always suppressing me or is to have intercourse. And he's like this to me now during the day. But I, I still don't want to have intercourse that frequently. (pause) But it's like, you know, he's making up for lost time and I'm not quite ready for it yet. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean not quite ready to make up for lost time yet?

</p><p>PATIENT: No, I want to kind of straighten my own thoughts out instead of going to bed when I don't want to. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You don't want to push him away (inaudible at 14:32)

</p><p>PATIENT: No, (pause) it's just like throwing him a bone. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I, (laughter), I guess it is.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, but I can't, you know, like, take it anymore. And this could irritated him. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not sure what you mean.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well like if I don't want to have intercourse I don't. I'm not excited about having intercourse.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you can't repent of these things.

</p><p>PATIENT: No. (pause) And this, is really getting to him. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he'd like you to (inaudible at 15:28).

</p><p>PATIENT: No, well, I don't know, maybe he would. But he just, it's, it's you know, that would be aggravating, if you, it's really an insult.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like you're undermining him, making him (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, and also puts him down.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) (pause)

</p><p>PATIENT: That's not really what I want, you know, I would like to go to bed and enjoy it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: More often than I do.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: More than once a month, which is about all that I enjoy it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Then last night he told me that he just couldn't even get an erection, even thinking about it like he used to. Well I think I have a little more sex for him now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not, I don't...

</p><p>PATIENT: Well like, like I - the way I feel about men. They can be just turned on just by anything. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Oh, but he's happy turned on by just anything.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not now. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes.

</p><p>PATIENT: Not now he can't.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes he can.

</p><p>PATIENT: He used to be able to. But I really, it really made me furious, it's you know, like I'm standing up a little more for my own rights around the house and now he's getting to me in a different way. So I think it's just a contract between the two of us. Where is [buy, get] (ph at 17:02). And I accused him of that. (pause) And he denied it, but I think it's sort of like, maybe he doesn't even realize it. I didn't think...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Whether or not he realizes that you're doing it consciously he (inaudible) it sounds like for you bed is like one more battle ground, you clean the house, children to bed and like your, I guess sort of struggling to be somebody stronger in (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Now I am.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. But it's like, so now the dinner's (ph) operation shifted to something else, I mean (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. Like, it's like I don't want to be strong. I don't want to have him in my power. I want to be able to enjoy sex.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. Exactly. (inaudible at 18:14) having him in your power and not enjoying sex. (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Is that where you are (inaudible)?

</p><p>PATIENT: But like I don't know how to go about it. You know, how you switch it in your mind. (pause) Maybe if I get stronger in other areas, I could use it in bed. (laughter) But it, but we really do need to have a division of power, sort of. You know in our marriage, because if he's always letting me down, I really, I feel like a whore in bed. You know, he's letting me down and, you know, you don't keep the house, you don't do this, you don't do that. I feel like just a mistress.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm sorry that. I really resent that you what's (inaudible at 19:19) like you don't belong there?

</p><p>PATIENT: Well I just feel like, like I, like everything I do is for him and that maybe if I do something that's for myself, (pause) (inaudible) I get, well really I just want to do something that's, I want to be selfish, I think. And do something for myself and then maybe I can relax in the bedroom. And maybe he can be the victim there or something.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like if you gave more attention to yourself, as time is evident (ph) you could submit. 

</p><p>PATIENT: I would, yes, I wouldn't feel like I had to be the ruler there because maybe I'm not so stupid anyplace else. I don't know. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So the one thing you don't know to do about all these things, the one thing it sounds like, boy that is one place where you are the ruler.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But you know like I never, it's nothing that you say out loud. Well, I mean, and like it never occurred to me, for seven years that I really did rule the roost there. No place else in the whole house, or the whole city. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: [They get these tagged] (ph) very nice, that comes with the product (inaudible) so powerful there all the time.

</p><p>PATIENT: Things like yourself. (laughter) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 21:04) are all here.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's the other way; I mean you really feel like a lad (ph).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It doesn't make you feel good at all? 

</p><p>PATIENT: No, it really doesn't. (pause) I wish I hadn't of said that. (laughter) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You think it's really funny that.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I mean I could have been putting in two cases (ph) in the kitchen. I didn't need (laughter) (inaudible). He'd let me.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I, yes, but I am getting much better that way. I'll at least argue and sometimes I win. And he [wouldn't fix it] (ph at 21:19). Wouldn't do us a lot of good. (pause) You know I think we have a break down in communication between, I went home and I said you're not taking that [three dream cost of drilling cords] (ph). And he said, oh thought the communication (ph). (pause) I don't know where he got that idea. Because I don't usually do things I want to do. Why he would think that I was going to do that. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) real puzzled.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, maybe it's starting to drive me crazy. I don't know (laughter). (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: What's it like having all of these arguments and all this anger fall (inaudible at 23:00).

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, like it was already decided that I was, yes indeed I was going to take that course. And he was like even surprised that I wasn't on the train with him going downtown. When we haven't, you know I said well I want to take it. And you always get to take what you want to take. Why can't I, and nothing was said. I mean I feeling better, and then he said, "Well yes, I thought were going to take it." This, is really kind of irritating. (laughter)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He won't even stand and fight. He backs away when your ready to stroke.

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) Yes. Takes all the fun out of marriage. (laughter) (pause) He's trying to confuse me I'm sure, because he's never let me spend money like that before. And I can't - I was talking to a girl about getting a part-time job at the university and he said, "Well I thought you were going to stay home." And that had me getting (ph) decide to be there. I think what he does is decide these things, you know. He goes ahead and then he forgets to mention them. (pause) Yes you'd think what he, we've been talking a lot more, but I guess what ever he's been listening to. Maybe we're talking more.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you think he hears?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How can you tell?

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes I even thought this, is easier. He had started getting better on me (ph at 24:44). (pause) He's sort of like my mother though; he wants me to build character. And I, I was thinking, you know, I was thinking how badly he wanted me to come to therapy and he would baby-sit and etcetera and now he's off downtown taking that course. And I'm running around getting a babysitter every Tuesday and Thursday. You know, like he pushes you into thing (cross talk) yes, he pushes you into things and then, you figure them out. When he said, you know, I'll do this and this, and this, and this. He takes after my mother. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: It's very hard to turn not caring very much (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: You know another thing I was thinking about, like what I, like last time I was saying how ugly I was, and it, I think that when I finally got my braces off it was really nice to have this power. Where before, the boys were giggling at me or hitting me. But it was really nice to be liked.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes. I thought you wanted to be, not you wanted to be liked, it was nice to, instead of having them swing at you and bribe you, you sort of played along (cross talk).

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) Yes. Yes a lot.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) by turning them on. (pause) (inaudible at 26:46)

</p><p>PATIENT: (pause) I don't think so, or they found what they wanted. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: But I think I was the one that really got dissed. I mean, I didn't like anybody. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well none of the boys I went out with did I really care that much about. It was more of a sport. And it still was sport. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Flirting (inaudible at 27:24) turn them on and then (snap)

</p><p>PATIENT: (pause) I wish I could have felt confident without having a boy on each (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Having a boy on each (inaudible) very effective (inaudible).

</p><p>PATIENT: You know, well it was kind of the whole high school that I went to. (pause)

</p><p>[Tape seems to jump to a separate interview at 29:24]

</p><p>PATIENT: Isn't a rule, you know, like she's really much too young. Like she's always going to be too young (laughter) as far as I'm concerned.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: She's really your baby. (inaudible) 

</p><p>[Tape jumps back to current interview at 29:38]

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Having a boy on each (inaudible) very effective (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, you know, well it was kind of the whole high school that I went to.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I - it's really too bad that (pause) well I guess that was the way that it was. (inaudible) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: That's the way it was and you were a victim (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, it was either that or not go to the party, or school (laughter). You know, I mean there was no dating around because someone might hit you (laughter).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So you didn't have a - any boys, (inaudible) real trouble. So you had to have a boy in order to survive (ph at 30:36). 

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I - it was really. It was really silly. (pause) I guess maybe it was (inaudible) everybody else was doing it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, I mean if it - had it been in another school where you just didn't have steady boyfriends. (pause) You know, you had an option and you could still go to a party or to a prom without a date. I don't know if there is such a thing as that. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Do you think it wasn't such a bad thing because, you know, I guess I don't know.

</p><p>PATIENT: I guess I don't know either. It's just that there was no way to change it. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And you made the best of it. There was no way to change it (inaudible at 31:56) or just don't where to change it.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. If you didn't have a steady boyfriend, you didn't have a boyfriend period. That was the only reason you didn't have one. And I think probably that the boys didn't really want to do that either. I mean they probably got sick and tired of being with the same girl. But they couldn't ask anybody else out because those girls were all going steady too. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So the boys were as much a victim as you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I guess they were. I think they were even in college in a sorority, it was only messing (ph) me up too. Because I thought, oh good, I'm going to be able to date around. Well they had these damn silly rules that you can't date two boys in the same house within two weeks of each other. (laughter) And I would be, you know, like, I remember a couple of times I had to stay home because I accepted a date where one of the guys in the same house and I'd already had a date with one last weekend, so I had to stay home. I had to break my date and stay home. That was kind of silly. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) essentially the same damn rules in college as you were in high school.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. It really is. You think you're going to be out on your own.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: And it's more (inaudible at 33:20)

</p><p>PATIENT: It's more complicated really, because you have to remember who - I mean you need a calendar (laughter) to mark them down, which house they came from. Thought I'd date independents, it would be (inaudible). (pause) So there's rules all over I guess. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: How do you tell (ph)?

</p><p>PATIENT: And after you get married you can't date anybody (laughter), so you - you're sunk again. (pause) I think I'll check into these schools before I send my girls. See what their dating system is. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I don't know where you are. I don't think (inaudible)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Yes, I guess, yes, and one thing is (inaudible) for you, like one, really you've had one (inaudible) after another. It was like taking out the trash (inaudible). 

</p><p>PATIENT: And yet I wasn't happy staying home. You know if just forget about it and not date anybody, you'd think your problems would be solved. But here you would be in the dorm all the time. It's not fun either. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Well, because I felt guilty then if I didn't study. And I didn't want to do that either. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: Right. (pause) One time I thought, well I'll get [campus help] (ph) before study and I still didn't study. I cleaned my room.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Like every, almost every guy you ever went with was anticipated (ph) by something.

</p><p>PATIENT: Sometime we were, yes. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Would you ever be able to just be with somebody you like to be with? (inaudible at 36:20) you wanted to be with them. That's all.

</p><p>PATIENT: I'm trying to think if ever did. (pause) Oh, you know, maybe he on the first, like when I - going back to high school on, maybe on the first couple of dates you liked to be with him, but after that, nobody would ask you out. You had gone with one guy two times. That was it.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: I'm not clear, you went with some guy two times and then he wanted to see you again and...

</p><p>PATIENT: No, then nobody else would ask you out because...

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You'd committed yourself.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. But I wasn't, I don't if I even felt that way in high school, like I was really crap. I always kind of dumb (pause), but I would never break the rules. (pause) And when I started going with Jim, like there wasn't anybody else to go with anyway. (pause) So might as well. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 37:37)

</p><p>PATIENT: No. None to speak of.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: No, then it wasn't to you.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. I guess it was. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Now the college men were (inaudible). (pause) (inaudible)

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes, well it was a small school. Everybody would know I guess.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: But I was wondering if that was like part of your reputation. 

</p><p>PATIENT: Oh I'm sure. (pause) Joel (ph) wasn't, yes, and if I was probably doing quality, sort of off somewhere always. (pause).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You mean sort of like he was the college man.

</p><p>PATIENT: No he was in the Army. He was always off somewhere.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Um huh.

</p><p>PATIENT: So you never really knew what he was like, you know. [It was the think thing] (ph at 39:20) you wanted to think about him because he wasn't there.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: He wasn't there.

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) We had a good thing going (laughter) (inaudible).

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible) 

</p><p>PATIENT: (laughter) Yes. (pause) Well I did say it wouldn't have been any different with anybody else anyway. You know, and that was another thing, you know, when you come from a small country town, it's, it's very important to be married. You know, as soon as your, like even as soon as you're out of high school. I thought I was really good because I waited two years.

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You won't.

</p><p>PATIENT: You are (laughter) that's right. All my friends were married, and I wasn't. I was beginning to think; you know at 20, I was going to be an old maid or something. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: So in your head he was a real catch.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: Because people... (cross talk)

</p><p>PATIENT: Well a man, yes. (pause) It's not a real good way to pick your mate. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You had to be there.

</p><p>PATIENT: Yes. It's just misfortunate. (pause)

</p><p>COUNSELOR: You look like you're in mid-thought.

</p><p>PATIENT: Well it's just thinking that, you know, we have our sex life, but we have every thing else is uncomfortable for me. (pause) 

</p><p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 42:07) but that the (inaudible) standing in the way of...

<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So how are things going?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not too bad.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, what's new, did you have a good [DATE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we went over to [NAME OTHER]'s mom and dads.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> His nephew is being shipped to [DEIDENTIFIED] -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> At the end of the month and we wanted to try and get a little get together in before he goes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's been all over the [DEIDENTIFIED] with special training and stuff and they gave him [DATE] till Monday, then he's got to go some other places for some special training, then at the end of the month he's sent out to [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it was really good seeing him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good, good.  So how have you been doing overall?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Pretty good, I'm still having such trouble with being able to have energy.  My energy level is down and I am just sleepy, sleepy all day long.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.  Okay, so then the challenge is to figure out why.  Are you sleeping okay at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, yknow, I think I am.  I caught myself waking up and I'll be sitting up and stuff.  But uh -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Apparently when I get really stressed or something, and I've done this since I was a kid, I walk and talk in my sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But I mean, I think I'm sleeping okay.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay. Does [NAME OTHER] ever tell you if you snore at night?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, he says I do.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and did you have any luck with that sleep study, I think we ordered that last month.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We did order it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'm going to have to hold off on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] did his and it was twenty two hundred dollars and we had to pay it so -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Insurance didn't cover it, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> They authorized it so I don't know why they're not covering it.  They said that was our portion of it, so I have no idea. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That sounds like the whole cost.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that's kind of what I thought but I just can't.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I understand, that's outrageously expensive.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, because I'm just wondering if you could have sleep apnea or some other sleep disorder that's making you so tired during the day. Wow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER] said they said he didn't have sleep apnea.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> But he has insomnia.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he just has the worst time trying to sleep too.  They said it can be hereditary.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And my dad had sleep apnea and insomnia and he would just do nothing but watch TV, sit in his chair, and just fall asleep all day long.  He's sleep walk, then he'd wake up and watch TV or something, then he'd fall back to sleep.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.  He had sleep apnea, okay, and there's so many different sleep disorders or sleep problems that can cause a person to not get restful sleep at night and still be tired all day long and there are some medicines that help with that and a lot of times people end up being misdiagnosed like with depression because they have all the symptoms of depression but it's actually from a sleep disorder.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The problem is the insurance companies usually won't pay for the medicines to treat it until you get the sleep study which is outrageously expensive so you're caught in a little bit of a bind here but I hope they'll come through and pay for some of [NAME OTHER]'s sleep study.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I hope so too because we've got medical bills just, you would not believe.  We probably owe seven, eight thousand in bills right now.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Wow, [PATIENT NAME], you might want to even call the insurance company and say hey wait a minute, this was authorized, yknow, what's your portion to pay because usually they'll cover them.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well that's where we got the statement from, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And they said the patient's portion was twenty two hundred.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That just doesn't make sense because, again, did he have a daytime study or just a nighttime study.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just a nighttime. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, see that usually costs about two thousand dollars so it sounds like they're making you pay the full thing for some reason.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Unless he, because of all the other medical, unless he's reached his peak.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, he could have maxed out.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Possible, I suppose.  Wow, okay, so how much sleep do you think you're getting at night, how many hours?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I go to sleep probably nine o'clock.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I get up, it's pretty different every day, between six, six thirty.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, so you're getting nine, nine and a half hours.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You should, it should be enough but I'll tell you I've had some other folks that slept that long and were still exhausted.  When they finally got the sleep study, they were, either didn't have very much deep sleep or they were being woken up repeatedly during the night and weren't aware of it, all kinds of things would go wrong.  Okay.  [PATIENT NAME], do you know how much you're weighing these days?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yes, 200 now [PHYSICIAN NAME].  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I had gotten down to 194.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I was so happy I was losing.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then it's just been this week, I've gained 5 pounds within three or four days.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I do that, especially over holidays.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> What's funny is I haven't been eating, I mean a lot of times I'm just starving and my stomach is growling and stuff -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I'll eat a little something just to make that go away but I'm not eating any more, probably less than I have before.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I was just doing so good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't know why now we're going way back up again.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay and how tall are you?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About five four, five five.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Okay.  I'm thinking about different sleep problems that might be contributing to being so tired during the day.  Do you find, I'm just thinking if I've got a scale here or not.  I don't have it here.  Do you find yourself falling asleep during the day a lot?  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No because I don't let myself.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Or the kids don't let me.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  You don't take naps or fall asleep at the dinner table or stop light or anything like that.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll tell you, I almost could of really coming up here today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was so sleepy and I just wanted to nod, open the windows or do something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you fight it?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Do you drink caffeine to stay awake?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have my cup of coffee in the morning and I've cut myself from two or three cups down to one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've cut out pretty much the pop, I'll have one once in a while but pop just doesn't taste good to me anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So you said you have how many now?  Did you say one a day?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One cup of coffee.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Of coffee a day and you've completely eliminated the pop?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Not completely.  If, yknow, we're out somewhere and we stop and get a drink, I'll, yknow, get a soda if they don't have the tea I like or something.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It just doesn't taste right to me anymore.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  And how's your mood been, has it been okay?  Are you feeling blue?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've been doing pretty good.  I've got, yknow, my days but I just do my best to try to change it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Sometimes it doesn't work.  I mean there's nothing you can do about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow, there's -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Just life that happens.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  What about your concentration and focus?  Do you do okay or is it hard?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's very hard.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  Have you been worrying about things?  Have you been worrying about things a lot lately or not too much?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I have a lot lately, just simply because we've got so many bills and they just keep coming and I don't have the money to pay them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The prices of food and gas have gone up.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [NAME OTHER]'s paycheck hasn't which really puts a strain on things, but -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yknow what makes it hard is I feel really guilty but I, I know I should get a job -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> To help with the bills and stuff -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I couldn't hold down a job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Because of the tiredness or -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because of the slow, tired all the time, I can't focus or concentrate and, well, it's been the same thing for years.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I wouldn't be able to hold down a job.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I mean even when I've done just volunteer stuff for somebody.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I think if I had to do this more than a couple hours a day or, yknow, as a permanent position, no way could I 'cause I'm so tired and I just, a lot of times, don't understand stuff and just can't concentrate on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's why I don't help the kids with their homework and stuff because I just can't, I can't think straight.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Okay.  What about, are you getting enjoyment or pleasure out of things like the picnic for [NAME OTHER]'s nephew?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that was fun.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Okay, what about stresses, besides finances and medical bills, anything else?  Are the boys doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, they're still working on the ticket that [NAME OTHER] got.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Nothing got resolved with that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, we did go to court and all that and it ended up where he had to do an alcohol drug class.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Twelve hours community service and he has to donate at least fifty dollars to the two charities that the court says these are the two you're going to donate to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay, and how long does he have to get all this done?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Until the end of September.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  So is he working on things to have them done by then, you think?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then I told him he's going to have to find money somewhere to pay for his stuff because we just don't have it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  Is he working right now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He's supposed to be working down at the warehouse.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he's been down there since May.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well they said they couldn't hire him until he was [AGE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, when does he turn [AGE]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> He turned [AGE] on the [DATE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So the guy told him, come in on your birthday, I'll interview you and we'll sit down, hire you, and you'll start getting money.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, the guy has not paid him any.  His interview consisted of one question and the guy asked him, do you want to do this the rest of your life and [NAME OTHER] said yes I do, I want to be a chef and he goes you're hired.  He never had him sign a W-2 or any kind of paperwork.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And he'll call an hour or so before [NAME OTHER]'s shift and say, oh we don't need you or he'll call [NAME OTHER] up and, like last week as a matter of fact, he was up at football practice and the guy called him, he called at four o'clock, he says I need him here by four thirty and I said I'll go up and look for him but I can't, yknow, guarantee you anything.  I went up and looked everywhere and finally found him and he went in to work for five hours washing dishes.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The owner got really mad at the chef and he told him you need to be paying that kid and so he gave him some money for that night and he called again Friday and said oh it's really slow, tell [NAME OTHER] not to come in and that's as we're trying to get ready to eat and everything so that we can take him there and then he said well I'll call and I asked him, I said are you ever going to give him a schedule and this stuff.  Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, I will, I'll do it on Monday.  I'll call him on Monday.  He never called Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or today.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That doesn't sound good at all.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I told [NAME OTHER], I said honey, I know you love what you're doing but he's ripping you off, he's getting free labor.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Right, it's illegal, I mean he can't.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It is.  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Not paying him for working.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Plus they never had him sign anything so, yknow.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're just paying him under the table so they don't have to pay taxes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> One time they paid him out of all these hours.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> How many hours do you think he's worked?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Usually he does, let's see, he goes in at five and he's done by, between eight and nine.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So three to four hours a shift and how many days do you think he's worked?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh gosh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Over the last couple weeks?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Three or four.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So he's got probably at least ten hours which is, if they're paying him seven bucks an hour, so that's seventy bucks, it's something they owe him at least.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.  But they haven't hired him so all they have to do is say we haven't hired him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It sounds like it's time to work somewhere else.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's what I told him.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, that's too bad.  Some of the companies are like that some of the restaurants, my daughter worked for a restaurant here and something similar happened.  She worked for two weeks, they wouldn't pay, a lot of kids quit.  They finally said it was just part of your training, you don't get paid for this.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> See that's what, yeah, even the other two shifts, two chefs -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Which are adults, they've cut their forty hours a week down to twenty four. </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> They're not doing so well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, exactly.   yknow, it's just a stress.  yknow, he was supposed to be working and paying for the situation he got in to and all that, well, he can't so we have to.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> So it's just, it's more stress on everything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.  Well, so there's plenty of stress there.  [NAME OTHER] is doing okay?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Good.  Well, I'm going to, I'm just thinking, is there anything else before we talk about what to do next? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I was going to ask you something.  To save my soul, I can't remember.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.  It sounds like from a mood standpoint, you're doing okay, it's more the energy and the focus right now.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And I guess our options are that we just leave things alone for now if you feel like you don't want to mess with things.  Two, when you can do that sleep study, that may, I suspect that's going to help us in terms of finding out what's causing you to not feel rested when you wake up in the morning and be so tired during the day, then we'll know how to treat it but I understand that may be a while before you can get that done.  Our third option would be to go ahead and sort of treat the low energy even though we don't know what's causing it for sure, what sleep problem or other problem may be causing it.  The thing that we normally use would be something like you've tried before like Provigil or Adderall or one of those kinds of medicine that are kind of wake promoting or energizing.  I don't know if you want to go back and try something like that again or if you'd rather not.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> No, I'm already on seven, 'cause [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s got me on two.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then Trazodone.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Trazodone, Lithium -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Cytomel -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The Cytomel and the Lexapro -</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> About six or seven of them.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  So you just want to leave things the way they are for now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Well, can taking all the medicine make me more tired?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, some of them can, like the Trazodone, how many of those do you take at night usually?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I take one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Just one.  I mean it could possibly, you could try, some of the people that will make them tired the next day.  We could try cutting back on it.  Now the ones they're giving you, are they scored where you can break them in halfs or thirds?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Its in an odd shape.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Kind of a trapezoid type thing. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I think you should be able to break those.  One of the things you could try is breaking off a third of it, so instead of taking 150, you'd be taking 100, and see if you still sleep well, if you wake up feeling more refreshed.  For some people that makes a difference. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We have now, what, two and a half.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I've gotten down to one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you've done real well.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We could try it.  I mean the worst thing that would happen is if we cut too much then you won't sleep as well as night, toss and turn, and if that happens you could always go back up again.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it might be worth trying to go down to 100 and see if that helps during the day.  Do you want to try it and see?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I'll try it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.   That might be better than adding in another medicine.  The Lithium normally doesn't make people real tired.  I don't think that's, the Cytomel doesn't normally and Lexapro rarely can but it's not a very common side effect, it's more likely from the Trazodone.  So why don't we just try cutting back on the Trazodone first and see if that helps. If cutting back to 100 mg, which is two thirds of a pill, doesn't work, you can cut those pills in half, try 75 and see if that works.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And if you have any problems or questions, you can call me but we may be able to just inch down a little bit more, ease down the Trazodone dose and see if we can find if it still helps you sleep well but you maybe not be tired the next day because Trazodone is one that can carry over to the next day if you take a little too much.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> If it's in the medicine, you'll start feeling better, you'll have more energy.  If it's not from the medicine, if you have a sleep disorder, it's not going to make any difference.  If we cut back too much, you won't sleep as well as night.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, that's why I really want to get that done.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.  You might even call the insurance and say, how much do you cover for this?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yknow, just to see, was it just that [NAME OTHER] was maxed out, will they cover it for you maybe or do they just not cover it, yknow, maybe you can just find out what's going on because that seems odd to me.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, me too.  I was so surprised.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And [PATIENT NAME], sometimes I've learned with insurance companies, if you call back and talk to them, sometimes they'll cover things they didn't originally.  They might have gotten the key to the computer wrong, all kinds of things can go wrong.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Sometimes just talking to them will, you can find a way to get it covered or maybe they're missing a letter from a doctor or something, there's all kinds of things that might help them pay for it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh, okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So does that sound like an okay plan?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Try to get the sleep study and cut back on the Trazodone for now?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, that sounds reasonable to me, too.  Like I said, if you have any problems, call me okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Now we know that depression or weight gain and you can't rule it because of depression and stuff, right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Some people gain weight when they're depressed, yes.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you think, in all honesty, that's what mine is?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's hard to know.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's like fighting a losing battle.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's one possibility.  It's also possible, there are people with sleep apnea that get real depressed because they're so tired and they eat more to stay awake during the day because they're so tired and if they treat their sleep apnea, they start to lose weight, their depression gets better, so I don't know which is the chicken and the egg, I think they're all related, the depression, the weight, the sleep problems, I don't know which one came first.  What we can't to kind of keep doing is kind of tackle them all, yknow, kind of the shotgun approach, try to tackle each problem, tackle the depression, try to get the sleep problem figured out and also try to lose the weight if you can.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> But it's tough if you're tired and not feeling good, yknow.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So get out and exercise or burn off, the way to get your metabolism back up.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Another thing that happens when people are real tired, the tendency to eat things that give you quick energy, sweets, because it kinda picks you up and helps you be more awake and alert, unfortunately, those are also things that put on calories, they just go right to the storage centers in the body so if we can get you more awake and alert, to eat different kind of foods and be more active, which will help you get the weight off.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> And again if reducing Trazodone does that, great, but again if there's a sleep disorder, we're going to have to eventually treat it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.  I've had bad knees -  </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And for me to exercise, like go running or something like that -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It's not going to happen.  I couldn't walk when I'm in pain.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And then when I hurt my knee a few weeks ago, yknow, the doctor said he didn't see where it was broke or anything but it still swells -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Um-hum. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> And I don't have the motion in it that, yknow, I did so I feel like I need to exercise, you've got to exercise if you're going to, I feel like I'm some kind of a, yknow, it's a catch twenty two thing, or circles -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, well and again I think [PATIENT NAME] if you had more energy and feel better, there may be other kinds of exercise that would be easier like swimming or going for shorter walks or something where you don't hurt yourself.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because it does make you feel better.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It does, energy wise, concentration wise, mood wise.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It doesn't have to be anything real big, yknow, you don't have to go out and run marathons, just even a short walk each day, just, you know, a few blocks, around the block or something to start with, something gentle and then gradually slowly building up really does make a difference.  They do repeated studies and every study they do shows that it really helps the depression to get out and just walk even.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The hard part is when people are depressed or tired they just don't feel like it.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> So let's try cutting back on the Trazodone next and see if that helps, I'm hoping it will.  If you have any problems, call me and then is there anything else you want to talk about before we schedule another appointment?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> This is off the subject but [NAME OTHER] wants to know if you have the information for the -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh, the reunion?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> The reunion.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You know, finally someone called or emailed me and there's actually, it's on the [DEIDENTIFIED] website.  There's a [DEIDENTIFIED] website now, did you know about that?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah, I know about that.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, you go to reunions I think and then there's a class of [DEIDENTIFIED] and there's a form in there to fill out and it says the deadline is like [DATE] or something but they said they'll take them after that, they were just trying to get a count.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay, because when I went on there it said we had to join the alumni, did you, are you a member?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Do you pay every year?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> No, no, yknow, maybe I can email it to you.  Let me get your email address, see if I can find it and email it to you.  What's your email address [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [DEIDENTIFIED] it's all lower case, at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, I'll see if I can go back and find that again and send it in.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Because every time I try to get on there -</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> It tells me you are not authorized to view this page.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, somebody sent me the link or whatever so I knew where to click on it, so I'll see if I can find that link and email to you or forward the email I got or something.  Are you going to go, do you know?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We're planning on it.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh good.  It looks like they're having a Friday night dinner at the hotel, buffet and things, then Saturday, did you see they're going to have like a picnic out of the park in [DEIDENTIFIED]? </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> We didn't know anything.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Yeah, they're having, the Friday night thing, I know my wife's not going, I know a couple of other wives that said it's going to be too boring, just everybody just sitting around talking.  It's at the [DEIDENTIFIED] </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Uh-huh.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> It's kind of expensive but there's going to be a group picture and some kind of book involved.  The next day is at this place called [DEIDENTIFIED], fishing, volleyball, lunch I think, it's not very expensive then so we're going to do, I think we'll take the family to that one probably.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Oh that's the fun one.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> That's the fun one, yeah.  Friday night will probably be a little boring but they'll be sitting there talking about old stories and stuff but Saturday should be fun though, so good, I'll find that and email it to you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> All right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> All right, let's set up an appointment.  Do you want to check back in a month, do you want to go a couple of months, what do you feel comfortable with?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Let me do a couple months?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That way I can try to get it worked out with the insurance because I really want to get that done and see if that's it, yknow, if it's </p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Contributing, yeah.  If you talk to them and they need anything at all from me, call me and I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help if they want a letter or anything like that.   Okay, so September then, does that sound good.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That sounds good.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> The kids will be back in school.  Do you want to do something mid morning again like this or earlier or later?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I've really got to do something about [INAUDIBLE].  Let's see, what do you have around, [NAME OTHER] is going to [DEIDENTIFIED] next year, so he starts later than he did this year, I think it's eight thirty and [NAME OTHER] starts at seven thirty, do you have anything around eight thirty, eight forty five or nine?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> We could do, I have on, we could do Friday [DATE], I have eight thirty, nine, nine thirty, whatever works best for you.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Why don't we do the nine o'clock?</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Okay, nine o'clock on the [DATE].  Would you like a card too [PATIENT NAME]?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Yeah.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Friday, [DATE] at nine, all right, here you go.  </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Thank you.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> You're very welcome.  All right.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> I'll probably see you at the reunion.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I hope so, that would be wonderful.  I hear thirty years will be the most fun one.  I said I can't believe it's thirty years since I talked to [NAME OTHER] about it.  He said by the time you do the thirty year reunion, everybody is glad to see if you're still alive, they don't care about anything else.  He said it's a lot of fun, much better than ten or twenty he said.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> There you go. [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Oh yeah, wow that's great. </p>

<P><B>PT:</B> [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> There are reasons for that, huh?</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> That's right.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> Well, all right, take it easy okay.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Okay.</p>

<P><B>DR:</B> I'll see you later.</p>

<P><B>PT:</B> Bye.</p>

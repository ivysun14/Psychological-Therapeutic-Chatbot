<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Today is February...uh...oh...March 1st? Is it really March 1st? My watch is one day slow. (chuckles) Today is March 1st, 1971. Let's see if we've got the thing plugged in. Yeah...this is only the tenth session with Tyler (laughter) (microphone drops, objects are moved around)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I need to just go to sleep there for the rest of the hour! (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Where's my coffee?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, you said you didn't want any.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I know. Okay, now, let's see if I got those things on...</p>

<p>PATIENT: So you're going to be here next Monday, though?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I'll be here next Monday. I might have to go to the hospital (inaudible1:04)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh my God!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm getting some X-rays done Wednesday. Let me turn the side. (door or window slams) Ummm...I don't think so...I don't think so. I think I have the (free will (ph at 1:32) to figure out what's going on. I've got to go get some X-rays first. Okay, yeah, right, okay. How are you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, let's see. There's a lot of things. Well no, that's not true. Maybe I should tell you some things that happened towards my progression toward Hell (laughs).</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) Progression toward Hell.</p>

<p>PATIENT: One more cross off of that. (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) What, this is serious here. What are they going to think when they are listening to this tape? (laughter) Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, my father came.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, that's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. He came last...when did he come...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible 2:32)</p>

<p>PATIENT: You did?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Flash...he came...this is a black fantasy. He came, and he made you go home with him and marry the boy next door. (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's my fantasy. Something like that? (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's way off. No, that's way off. I mean if he did that, that would be sort of an improvement in the (inaudible 2:55)...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Knew at least wanted...what I was going do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That he was thinking about you sometimes?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Even if the boy next door could be a real sh...you know. But, no, he came and it was very funny sort of. Like I went...went out to dinner Tuesday night with some friends of mine and so that was nice and then Wednesday I went out to dinner alone with him, yeah, I guess that was it...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Alone with your father?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And we were talking about teaching and stuff like that and I was saying things like I wanted-I was going to-in fact I was going to go down and say, you know, "Why haven't you developed emotionally?" Because I felt like I really wanted to say that to him, you know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm, Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But it think it would just sort of-he wouldn't even know what to do with that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So, we started-we were talking-when we were talking the tune of education and things like that, he could handle that very well. He had definite ideas and things like that, so it could go back and exchange. So then I said to him, I said "Well what's really interesting is I took it so emotionally, this whole student teaching thing." I got panicked a lot of times and frightened a lot of times and things like that. Well, he completely ignored it. He said, "That happens a lot in student teaching. It's not a real experience. It won't be like that next year." You know, and he just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like he just ran away from it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I sat back then. All I could just say, you know...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well, well, now wait a minute. What did that do to you? What was that? Were you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well-no-on there-see usually, before this, I would be just sort of really kind of crushed. Like knowing it was going to happen. I mean I just that it always sort of happens, but always-I always get this sort of very empty feeling. You know, just...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm, Um Hm, Um Hm. Is that how you felt then?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I figured like-I felt sorry for him. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: But you see, that what I'm saying in terms of well (inaudible 4:56) that thing towards health (ph 4:57) and stuff took me so long to sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, wait, let me, hold on, let me, let me sketch with that. Sounds to me there's a difference there with what you used to feel of-like there was something wrong with you or you would punish yourself in some way. This time you would run into yourself or something like this. You saw him-you saw yourself kind of standing there and he was like way out of it or something. And you just felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Before I used to say "Why is it-what's with you that you can't this man to sort of respond emotionally to you?" "What were you as a daughter what-you know." "What's the story with you, you, you." And now I could just say I really feel badly that he never opened himself sore (ph 5:43). </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, and I just-I can see him getting sort of harder and harder and more closed and more closed.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And that's the sad part about this</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's for him, not for you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: : No, but then you say...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you get kind of scared, that maybe you're like that sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Tell me...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe I am like that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, maybe you are like that, too. I see. So you two are a lot in that way, maybe-alike in that way, maybe.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I can see-I think in some ways we are for example. And one-because this is what I was thinking of-and one way is that whole thing with me and criticism sort of. You know, I really want to be a sort of really open person and (inaudible 6:37) that though when you open yourself up there's going to be people who will criticize you and things like that. I mean I-see that-what I think he does is that he puts a shell around him...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait, wait, wait, let's go back there. You're giving me too much stuff to do. It's going too fast for me. That part about-damn it, I missed it. Something I really wanted to say about that. It had to do with-let's see if we can backtrack a little bit for me. It was right after-oh, I just had something to say. We looked at both halves of what that-what him being hard was. Then you said you were afraid-then you started to say you were afraid you might be something like that, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I thought I also heard in that-now check me if I'm wrong-it almost sounded to me-my flash was-it wasn't your words, but my flash was like you were angry with him too, or now. And I don't know if this is right at all, but I thought I heard a spot of that where-and I wanted to say if that's true-I mean I thought I heard some anger there addressed. But then I heard you try and take it back maybe. This is my whole flash on that. And I want to say it's all right to be angry if that's where you are with him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You know. Does that make any sense to you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think I did. I mean like I sort of rationalized it, know what I mean. Not rationalized, but sort of intellectualized an emotional sort of response to him.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, when I sit here putting myself in that situation-I just hear myself being with my mother-it's like tense anger, like feeling very tight around there. Like it was very hard for me to even get in touch with that anger. I can feel myself clutching-things like that.</p>

<p> What I want to say to that-I mean, you took the words out of my mouth, saying "What happened? Why can't you relate emotionally at all to me? Why do you..."</p>

<p>PATIENT: But see, I can't relate-what that-you know-what-all right, all these other things-so like that when I left Wednesday, he was leaving-he had another day of meetings on Thursday and was leaving very early Friday morning. So I said to him "Well, if you give me a call Thursday, I should be in Thursday night if you, you know, call so we can chat" because he had some interest in what this guy was saying. He said "Well, I don't know-yeah, well I don't have time." Then he said "Well, I mean I'll try." I felt like he honestly really didn't have time for me. And when he said "Well, I'll try" it was almost like my mother sort of saying "Well, Ted, you go out there and you know." You know?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You go out there and?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Be very nice to Jennifer.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see, oh yeah. Oy, yuck. So at least even at times he was with you it didn't feel like he wanted to be there. It was like because he had to or something. Is that right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I just felt that he's a very-I was just very uncomfortable. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Like if he had his druthers, he'd rather be in Philadelphia. Right? And that for me feels like being alone in a crowd. It is-that's-it's like if I'm going to be alone, I'd rather do it by myself. You know? F**k off! You know, don't do that for me. Don't do-if you're going to be with me, be with me because you want to be here. Don't...don't f**k up my time like that. Make me think I'm going to get something from you. You want to be with me and then you're just there with this front. Is that sort of...? That's what it is like for me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is that you see like I think-he's so like involved in this-in his-see, I can see...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now you want to make apologies for him.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Why do I want to do that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: F**k him, f**k him. He's three times seven (ph 11:12). Do for yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Granted he has reasons, too, but that doesn't mean it should get in your way. You don't have to put up with that stuff, right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now see, I find that really hard to do.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Be angry at him. It's okay. But don't take it away. He f***ed around with your time-worse than not coming in some ways, I think. (inaudible11:46)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well he might as well not have come.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Well it all sounds like all you did is get your expectations raised a little bit maybe even? Or something like, something like that but I might be...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I thought something-well, we might sort of really communicate, you know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it wasn't. I got too freaked in his big shadow. I got (inaudible 12:05)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. I'm not, you know, like-well...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But then I get-I can...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you trying to help him?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Trying to what?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Trying to help them? Help him? What are you trying to help him in? Because you felt like you were trying to get closer or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I wanted to. But see, I didn't-you know what-for example, I just felt very-I couldn't be like very affectionate around-I felt-I mean I really felt very strained with that man.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did you feel like when it was over that part of it was your fault maybe? Like you couldn't break through or something?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, much less than I ever have before.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fantastic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Much, much.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Fantastic.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You know, like...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I was so afraid for you that you would blame yourself for this.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, not at all.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Good, good.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But what I did feel was I just then sort of selfishly was wondering if I would ever turn into be him. Because I think I can see why he's done all he's done sort of. [13:08]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And just withdrew more and more into himself and built up all this shell.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah, um, okay. This is important stuff now. But I don't know where it is for you. What are you afraid of, I mean what's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could see myself maybe doing the same thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Because you said there has to be some reasons and you must have some of the same reasons. You said there were some-you could see the reasons why he is what he is. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You must have some similar reasons. Hmm?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, well, um...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my reasons-I don't know his reasons.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: For you, I mean for you. Why are you going to be crazy? (laughter)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think that sometimes like for me-let me see-see I, I sometimes get hurt in ways that-like I set myself up-this, this-I know this isn't going to make any-set myself up sort of for a hurt, you know. Like open the situation, create it and things like that. By how I act or what I say. Then when I get just what I set myself up for I mean it really, really hurts me. Like last night what ha-this-well, wait. Does that make any sense to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I understand that. That's like saying you somehow-what you do self-defeats what you want or something. [14:45]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And also, you see, what I want-what I do and what I want is sometimes what I'm not-it's not like what I'm feeling at the moment.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah ha. It's...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now by that I mean kind of like I think I overcompensate for how I'm feeling by what I act. Like, for example, if I go into a new situation with people, you know, I think I'm really like-I play like I don't give a damn, I'm really cool and stuff like that. And inside I'm not feeling that at all, at all. So for someone else, I mean, and I sort of fantasize or exaggerate rebuffs and things like that, I think. No, I think I know. You know, and I do that. And I mean...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a second, wait, hold the phone. But that's what you're doing, too, isn't it. It sounds to me that you're not being who you are and so they're responding to somebody who you're not. When they respond to somebody who they're-who you're not, how can they get with where you really want to be?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Why can't I really be what I am?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah ha! So that's the question. (chuckles) Okay, oh, sure. I guess (inaudible 16:03). It's because when you are, at least with your father, you don't get it anyhow and so you've got to try to be somebody else with him, for example.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean, you've always been somebody else with him than who you are, right? Because you had to be. You have to realize it's not everybody, it's your father. (laughter) Right? [16:29]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right! (laughter)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah ha! (laughter) Yeah, right. But that's a problem. I mean, I don't want to (inaudible 16:33) laugh about it, but that's hard for you, isn't it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's really hard when you go into the situation and...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really think I'm hardly myself with anybody. A couple people, maybe, but really not very many. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're going to have to try for advice-for hindsight and advice? Okay, you're going to have try gradually you can't like, you can't just-don't do the thing where okay now I'm going to be open with everybody. I do that and I get killed. I mean, that's not the way to do it. Better, you know, like try people gradually, to try to be more open with them. And be more who you are with them and how you feel. You don't have to do it with everybody or nobody, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I really, I guess I-it's like I'm denying what I am, sort of, and being what people want me to be. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. That's right. That's what you're doing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I know I'm doing it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah? Okay. So it sounds to me like you can't-like it's a big problem all the time that you're saying. Or a good part of the time.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it goes back to the problem-for some-a real need to be liked.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, sure! Of course. Of course, now we know that part, right. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Now what are we going to do about it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: We-okay. So, what do you want to do about it? I mean it's something-it sounds to me like it's something you have to do.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, what I'm saying...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What I'm saying is-okay can you hold for a moment? It's okay? It sounds to me like you have to do something, though. I mean, it sounds like you're really in touch with the way you are about that and what you do wrong and what you do right and how you feel about it this way and how you feel about it that way. It sounds to me like you have to do something about it. That make sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know what to do, though. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think you're going to have to make some concerted efforts to think of somebody-X Y-who you want to try to be more open with. Who would that be, for example? I mean there must be-is there somebody who you'd like to get closer to?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Who?</p>

<p>PATIENT: This one guy I know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Ah ha. So? He's homework for the week. (chuckles)</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh that lucky guy! (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm serious. I'm serious.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know you are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like-I'm afraid if you're going to-you know, want to just do it with everybody or you're going to wait until you're cured and then do it with everybody as opposed to, you know (chuckles)... Okay, but you're going to wait-that's not how it works. You're going to have to try a little bit with this-you know, like one person at a time. You have to think about it at the moment. It's like quitting smoking. You don't just quit smoking. You quit smoking this cigarette today, now, this moment. Then in an hour you might have to quit smoking again. You know, you can't-Okay, I'll wait until July and then I'll quit completely. That's not how it works. I don't know if that analogy is true for smoking, but (inaudible 19:53) but I think there's other things, you know, it's true. [19:55]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Mmm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think that makes sense?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it does, but...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But, what doesn't make sense inside some way?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, inside for some reason I really don't think it's going to work.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Okay, your inside doesn't feel-does that-okay, but what else does that tell you, what else? Oh, I know, you're saying how-is it deeper than that? Is it more like-does that say something about you or what does that say something about?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. It says something about me and it also says something about sort of other people.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, okay, there's risks involved. The other part for people are the risks. They may not...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...be able to help, you know, or be with you when you are who you really are.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's it, that's it. See, that's it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That may be true.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, no, and also that's the thing with my father. I mean, I know that that's what he-like he closed completely off emotionally because he's too afraid of the risks.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. [20:54]</p>

<p>PATIENT: You see, and since I feel that way, too, that kind of frightened me that "My God, I've turned into him."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right...yeah...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of a ....</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...I see...</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...stone-faced robot. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, I get that. You're going to have to take some risks. Yeah, I'm sorry, we can't just bleed in here. You've got to go do something out there, too. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You don't get in therapy for the (inaudible 21:25) and then it goes away. You know, it doesn't go phhhffft-pssst. (chuckles) You have to do stuff out there, too.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I'll have to work on that, you know, doing that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I think you have a pretty good unders-it feels to me like you have a very good understanding-or a fairly good. I mean, you could have different understandings of it, but even when you have different perspectives and all that and different edges. But I think then you still have to do something. I'm not sure-well like more understanding with help, I think. I don't think it would make the behavior you have to do much different. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, now, where are you. Phew. (inaudible 22:14) I always keep quiet here. I'm talking too much. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) No, I was just-I was thinking of-you want me to tell what happened to me last night? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, what happened to you last night?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think this has-there's one role that I've decided that I always play. Yeah, I-and I deliberately play it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What's that?</p>

<p>PATIENT: And that's like being sort of-now how-it's not-it's funny, it's being funny, though in a way of like so people don't take me seriously. You know what I mean? I mean, like, I don't-there's a lot of things I don't...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're the same thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...you know, I don't think of and stuff like that. For example, my-it looks like, you know, like this and I never...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What do you mean?! What a minute! What's wrong with this? (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs) I can never find things and little things I just-and I-and so this sort of, I think, builds and stuff. And...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You come off as being...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, I come off...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible23:28) at other people, I bet?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: How do you think you...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I think I come off as people as being sort of scatter-brained, sort of amusingly ridiculous-you know, like straight, sort of uniquely sort of out of it type, you know in a way like you're head's not quite...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Not quite screwed on tight. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not a bad head, I mean it's fun and all, but it's not quite connected properly. Nothing serious, you understand, but you know she's fun and all that but, you know, you're not going to talk to her about an idea.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right? Is that...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Now, I perpetuate that.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I definitely perpetuate that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So last night, we were smoking and this one friend of mine was laughing at everything I said. I said to him "Why don't you take me seriously?" I was saying something-I said, you know, I'm taking something. I got very serious. I thought I was going to help him because I decided that he couldn't take compliments. And I really, I really wanted to help this guy learn to take compliments. So I said, you know,...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wait a minute. Hold. I think I have enough already. I think-I want to tell you-I'm going to warn you against something, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What? [24.40]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Part of that is in you. Like somewhat you create that impression. Okay? Now that's what you're saying, right? </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm saying that's probably true. Okay? But, a good deal of that is out there, too. I mean, I mean there's something about unless girls have very thick glasses and they're short and ugly, we're not going to-men aren't going to listen them seriously. Something-there's a big thing in that, let me tell you. I do it myself and I know about it. I'm not unaware-you know-I think I'm pretty into what makes me tick. I do it yet. I don't do it all the time, but I have to catch myself, stop myself. So, it's not all you. So now I want to know what happened. Okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: So all he did-I mean, I know that he was out of it and that's why he was reacting-he was high and stuff. But all the Goddamn kid did was laugh and laugh and so I said, you know-then I sort of was getting very angry, kind of, you know? </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And it was like about six filters and he wouldn't, he wouldn't stop lau-now, so I became almost paranoid about that. I mean like I got sort of really angry. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: Then I didn't even want-I mean, I figured he wasn't worth pursuing with it like he wasn't even sort of down enough to talk. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. That's a very good one. Let's talk about that awhile, okay? What do you think the mistake was-how did you feel? First of all, how did you feel afterwards? I mean, what was it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well, at first I felt very angry at him, then I felt very angry at myself and I said "You know Jennifer, you create that in yourself."</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. I'm very angry at part of you too. It's not the part that that is a f-do you know what part that is? Well, no, that's not true. Something like you've made a mistake. The mistake was not in doing that, but was expecting that he would take it seriously. It's not what you did that bothers me at all, okay? I mean, what you did sounds very good to me, the whole thing. What bothers me is that expected it to-you expected-like you beat yourself for it not working. When it was really out there.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I did the same thing. It's like when I-I got a lot of bad feedback about that (inaudible 27:03) a lot of good stuff, too, for example. A lot of very good stuff and a lot of very (inaudible 27:08) stuff, too. Phew.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Shit hit the fan, okay? And nevertheless, I keep getting hired other places. I'm glad I did what I did, but what I do sometimes is I don't expect to get that hostility. Okay? And that's na�ve, stupid. If I'm going to be that high self-disclosing and that high out there, I'm going to get clobbered sometimes. Or, or if you expect them to have troubles with that, that's their thing. That's really their thing. But, I should know that, so I can-I don't feel-have to be angry at myself afterwards. Okay? In other words, I'm going to do the same thing, but next time I expect it. So that's the only part. And the other part is you can't go off and help people like that. They've got to come to you and really twist your arm. Particularly you. That's true for me, too. I get involved to where I want to try to help people that have them come to me crawling on their knees for something, you know? Really wanting it. But when you see something out there that you know is obviously out of order and you had the key to put it back into order, it's very difficult not to go put that key in the lock and turn it. Okay? The trouble with that, unless they ask you to put the key in the lock, whether it works or not, you're liable to have a lot of trouble. You can still go do that. You can still go put that key in the lock...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...but just expect the trouble. Sometimes you wont' get it, sometimes you will. But you can-it's going to be harder for you than it is for me. I mean, you're a girl. You know, we hold prejudices, you know? You're too pretty to know anything, you're-you see what I mean? All those things you've got-you're up against-really up against a wall I see. Now part of that was I think what happens to you, but part of that was what's happened to males. Meaning, if you're going to help them, you really have to be subversive or something like that. See what I mean?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I really do. But that was-oh, I was just-so I resolved that I wasn't ever going to say anything funny anymore. I was going to be really serious all the time. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughter) Oh, shit, you'll never pull it off (laughter). You'll never pull it off. You can't do that. Is that worth it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Is that worth it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I would like to, for awhile. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, so that's good, like, so you could do it either way, depending on what was best for you. Now that makes sense. I don't still think it's going to work, but it makes sense to try it. No, you know, it's going to be hard. Because it sounds like you're going to have to deny part of yourself or something in order to do it. Or you could think of it as developing a new area, too. Either way, both ways, but they both have their...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I wonder why I do that, though.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Wonder why you...be more specific now.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Sort of create that image of being really sort of...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The image is out there, it will tack onto you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I think I definitely do things to...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Are you just trying to find out what specific things you do or no? Or what's inside of you that makes you do it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Makes you-yeah, I mean-see I have this feeling that I use that as an excuse to get out of things later on. Does that make any sense to you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, sure, sure, sure. Okay...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know I use it to get out of relationships that are getting too heavy for me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Right, right. But you shouldn't-yeah, yeah...</p>

<p>PATIENT: But I think I'm really aware of that now and maybe I wouldn't do it again (inaudible 31:22) But, for every-I don't know, I don't know if that's really true or not. I don't know. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like it's not...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...what difference does it make for you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's what I'm thinking now.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean the point is for you what do you want to do?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I-see-I wonder what-the thing that really bothers me is that need I have to sort of have people think highly of me.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. I have that need, too, sort of.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well that really-I think that's horrible. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (laughs) All right. I think it's horrible to need other people, is it?</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, no, to have other people...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Approve of you.. I see, okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I think that's why I project faces-I mean different fronts. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm</p>

<p>PATIENT: So I say what I think this person...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What front are you doing here?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I really don't-oh I had one when I started (chuckles). I don't think I do now. Do you?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't know-I just was wondering if you thought so. I don't think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So why don't you be like you are with me with other people?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I' d rather-not other people are like you.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that would be an advantage. I mean this. There are sort of more of us around than you think there is, I think.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No, I really don't. I've never come across that many who like so really want to hear what you have to..</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Mmm.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. Yeah, I ha-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Maybe you can do some more drawing on what it is-you may have to do some more drawing out before you-you know like serious drawing out of other people. There's-I gave you some-a bunch of those exercises...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...the drawing out-there's one I think called "Drawing Out." Play with that a little bit, okay?</p>

<p>PATIENT: All right. Yeah that would be good because I've only done that focus facilitator thing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. No, do the-do the drawing out thing. It sounds to me like you've got to get a little bit lower on being out front and more in pulling other people out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Like stop thinking about sort of myself in a situation...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And start pulling the other person out. Forget about your feelings for awhile, you know, and then finally they'll come around and ask you your feelings. And then you may have a hard time getting in because you'll keep drawing them out. I'm serious! It could reverse on you, it could reverse on you. Then you cou-then-because it reverses on me every once in a while. </p>

<p>PATIENT: (chuckles)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It does. I still have some trouble. I can do both very well. Or I can get into my soul very easily. But I can also draw people out. Sometimes I forget I know how to do both. Then it gets-it gets to be still very, still powerful for me to alternate. How do you alternate? So you get what you want out of life? Some have trouble but-so that's a-so-sounds to me where you're at is you've got to try more of the drawing out. [34:37]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I definitely have to do more of that. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Do a practice some of it on me. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Drawing out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Sure, why not?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know, I was thinking what I-what to do to draw you out.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Go read the manual. I haven't read that manual by the way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That's a good one because-</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Practice on me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could come in and draw you out. (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: No, I'm serious!</p>

<p>PATIENT: I know. I am too. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'm dead serious. But it's funny, but it's also very serious. And I haven't read that thing by the way, that paper that I gave you that I think is fantastic. But I've seen someone do it who wrote the thing. I mean I know the guy personally who wrote the stuff. And I've seen him do something out of his stuff. Very good, very good. So I think it could be helpful because it's going to be helpful. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Um Hm.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So I won't read it until you go practice some it on me and I'll probably be little bit more na�ve...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...about what the specifics are and see how they work. Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That'd be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I'm a real manipulator. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oohh...</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I wonder why you said that. That's interesting.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because remember that-about the third session here when you were talking all those terms around.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh, I see, I see. So you identified with information that-I see, yes that's right. That all right, I'll take my chances. (laughs)</p>

<p>PATIENT: (laughs)</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'll take my chances. But you're right about that. There is something manipulative about (inaudible 36:29) private information... </p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: ...about what you're doing. And other than that, giving it to the other person. Which reminds me, I'm going to give you the (text ph 36:38) of my book so you know the whole story (inaudible 36:41).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh good. I have (inaudible 36:44) to complain yet because I didn't get it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh! I forgot your sex books. God!</p>

<p>PATIENT: How could you forget my sex books?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Did I forget your sex books? Damn it! That's right, I forgot your sex books. (inaudible 37:00) I'll do that next time. Wait I've got to take a note on that. I looked up-I went home and looked up in all my sex books about you-know-what, about masturbation, right. And I wanted to bring you down to two volumes that I found something in. It was just right where you-you should look at it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I'd like to, really. .</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That would be good.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I read the whole business. It's not a big thing, I didn't go into, you know-I went into some of the less technical stuff. That stuff is almost textbook stuff now. (inaudible 37:45) But anyhow, yeah, quite-very interesting. I also went home and masturbated for the first time in three years.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Did you?!</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not bad. Let me see. Where are we?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I had a funny-I felt-after that session, at first I felt like for about-just for may-it wasn't very long-maybe fifteen minutes or so after that, I was thinking about it kind of sort of guilt shame sort of. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Um Hm. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Like well ashamed that I had told you and stuff like that. I said f**k it. </p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Oh yeah, there's an idea. You know, did we-we have to talk about that some more. We could do more with that, I think. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Well guilt is a big thing with me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, you've got a lot of that. We should talk more about that around that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: ...that really hangs on for so damn long.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That could be very good talk about.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You could be Jewish you've got so much guilt. No, that's shame. That's another story. Yeah, we know all we-like I want to hear more, like I felt I wanted to tell you that. I almost called you on that. I think there was one point that we went this way as opposed to this way. This way was good, too, but then we have to go another way with that, I think yet. I can't-let me see if I can pull it up. Yeah, I don't think we did enough with your feelings about that. I think we came up with a too easy solution about it too quickly like it wasn't really a problem. We've got to talk more about how you feel about it, okay? I missed that. I almost called you to tell you I missed it. I figured it would come out (inaudible 39:28). If I had the books, that would have reminded me. The books were going to remind me, right? I took the books out, I put them down...somewhere (chuckles) so I wouldn't forget to bring them in. Now, they're probably very near the door by my apartment. But they're right at the door waiting so I couldn't forget them. [39:48]</p>

<p> The problem was I did a group last night for six hours and I was just wiped out.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And I did some-I helped somebody get out of her apartment yesterday, dropped in from California and so I was going from-I got off at four and went to two. </p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it was a busy day and I forgot the sex books. So they were supposed to remind me. But anyhow, we should talk more about that. Okay, how about Monday at eleven, okay? Okay, what else? Is there something else? Twelve o'clock. What's going on.</p>

<p>PATIENT: No.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Nothing else.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. It seem like we did a lot of stuff today.</p>

<p>PATIENT: We did. You know and I-I didn't think I had anything to say. Isn't that unusual?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I, I, I have a lot more to say. I have-what happened to me! No, I have a lot of stuff I wanted to say.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Really?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay, now.</p>

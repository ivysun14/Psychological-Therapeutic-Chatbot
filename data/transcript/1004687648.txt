<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's going fine. Fine. How was your, um, what do you call it, like it's not a, it's a, a residency?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: It was so great (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It was um like the best thing I've done in 4 years. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (laughs), yeah. It was wonderful. Yeah, I'm so glad that worked out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, it was just helpful in a (laughs) lot of ways. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. Well, that's really terrific. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's about time for something to go really, really well like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah (laughs), yeah, um.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean not that you don't have some things that have gone really well, like, ya know, your relationship and like stuff at work, but I think you were frustrated about a lot of things (inaudible at 00:00:53].2) too. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel like I haven't had a situation since college...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...when I had like a group of people who I really liked who liked me (laughs), um, and ya know I felt like I actually fit in. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's perfect, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:01:08].7) your experience of graduate school. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No, um, maybe when I was working in communications...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know like I had friends in the office, but I never felt like oh, these are my people (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so it's really cool feeling that for the first time...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:01:29.2] </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in 4 years (laughs). Um, so, yeah, that was amazing. Um, and (pause) yeah. Um, yeah I've been feeling a lot better lately. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm feeling sort of ill like physically today. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So (laughs) so my (inaudible at 00:01:48].7) is not what it could be, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, not like disease, it's just not a great time of the month (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that sort of dampens, ya know, the positivity I was (laughs) feeling. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but, but yeah. Things have been good. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, I...so I'll be here ya know this week and next week. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I'll be in Kentucky for a week and Texas for 3 weeks. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I'll be back in the last week of August. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Um, I uh, uh, if it works for you I think this time works for me again next week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and then umm, do you want a...should be schedule something for the last week of August as well, or do you want to just let me know around when your getting back and we can figure something out?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I can e-mail you, cuz I don't have my plane ticket yet for the return. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that would be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. And do you want me to keep this hour or does it not Jeffer or is there something better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know my schedule will be flexible, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. [0:03:17.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...if it would be more convenient for you. Like if there's something one else who doesn't have such a flexible schedule...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...like you can do that or...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: We can probably (laughs) (inaudible at 00:03:32].7).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, so...uh (laughs). It's been such a lifetime since we talked (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It totally has, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah. The first week of residency was actually rough, um, because I had tried to start birth control again. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I tried something that I was using like a year ago...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it went really badly and I got like tons of migraines and... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it was kind of crazy (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was also sort of like hmm, I was on this for months and I, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and I had started it when everything started going wrong so it was like oh, I'll just have, ya know, one less thing to worry about. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So it was like hmm (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. How much of a factor was this? Yeah. [0:04:28.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think I really react pretty badly (laughs) to medication (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That certainly seemed to happen in a few cases, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Um, yeah the Dexedrine seems to be the only thing that doesn't like really have super negative effects. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that the migraine medication?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it's the ADD stuff. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: The migraine med just makes me like really tired (laughs) which isn't so great. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I actually can't take it every day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I probably should just to try to keep myself used to it. But it's always hard being like okay, I'm gonna take this thing at 5:30 and have a tired evening. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup, that sucks. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so yeah, but anyway this is just because of, ya know, hormone thing. Like the first week was rough and um...no, it was sort of some place where you had to rely on the people around you because you weren't allowed to talk on cell phones inside of the buildings...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and so you had to like, ya know, go outside to talk and there was, ya know, and there was only Internet in like the main building, so you couldn't really like Skype with anyone or like, um, so I just didn't talk that much to people in my life. Um, ya know, I mostly talked to Jeff but not even every day. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:05:57.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, cuz some days I didn't really want to like wander around outside with the mosquitoes on my cell phone (laughs). Um, so, yeah I mean in the first week like we were just all getting to know each other and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How many people were there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, 15 people. Um, and I felt a little bit self-conscious because of the...I think there were 6 writers. I was the only one who didn't have some sort of degree in writing, whether it was like an undergrad degree...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or an MSA.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And the other writers were much more professional about their work. Um, and ya know like 3 of them were even...had stuff published...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: in respectable places. Um, then there was like a 27-year-old who had been a [inaudible] recipient and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that another fellowship? Or another residency?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is, it's one of the two most prestigious residencies for writers in the country. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. [0:07:02.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so it's a really big deal (laughs) to get in there. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so I, I, ya know, felt sort of like the country bumpkin (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but...I mean I think having a small group and having writers and visual artists and composers made it a really noncompetitive environment, and people really just were so supportive of each other and that was really cool (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, because I feel like you know in grad school there's definitely not sort of this overall expectation that people will be supportive and like looking for the positive and looking to help each other (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That was certainly how you described it. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs). Yeah. Yeah, and like in communications ya know like people at the office were very nice...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but there is this like sort of like fast-talkin', hard-hitting culture...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that...I mean, ya know, I wouldn't call it supportive. It's like, ya know, nice people acting like sharks because that's what you do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [0:08:18.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Um, and ya know once I got to know the other writers like they gave me a lot of advice about, ya know, like structure and organization and process and like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...we were talking about strategies for dialogue and like, ya know, the, how volatile like your narrative voice can and should be...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and the role of humor, like just all this cool stuff that I've sort of been wanting to discuss with people and not really had like an outlet for that (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, even criticism. It's not like you can change the narrative voice. You have to sort of seek it as it is and comment on what it is, ya know, like...ya know it would be like the author should have done (laughs) (inaudible [00:09:10].1) it would have been better. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles). Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and it was just in the first couple of weeks I was like pretty, ya know...like the first week I was just sort of a little crazy for medicine reasons.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [0:09:28.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then the second week I was just really like having fun and writing whatever I felt like writing at the moment and writing (inaudible at 00:09:37].9) stuff.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then, ya know, the first reading started picking up. We had to read our work out loud.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and they wanted us to read stuff we had written there ideally, but ya know that wasn't like required.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I was trying to work up a scene but it just wasn't...like the two I thought would be like good for people who had no context...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...just weren't really wanting to fit into that sort of time limit. Um, we couldn't go over 7 minutes, which means, ya know, probably my first thing was like 4-1/2 double-spaced pages and that was too long. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm, I see. [0:10:25.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then my second one had to be 3 double-spaced pages because they said like the last big reading like we really can't go over (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and so it was, it was sort of hard getting something that was really compelling, had a beginning, middle and end. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And didn't require a lot of outside context (inaudible at 00:10:45].2) short. Um, so yeah I was really freaking out, like extremely anxious (laughs) at both of the readings. Um, it was like I wanted (inaudible at 00:11:00].0) the last day. Um, and they had like members of the...the outside community. Because a lot of people in Woodstock are into the arts and like want to come out and hear people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) So, that was neat. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but it was funny because before like going I had only showed parts of my novel to my friend Michelle and so it was really terrifying to like stand up and read it to a group of my peers. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine it would, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I just became so miserable. I mean I think was really worried because the novel is something that allowed me to be sort of hopeful and not have to answer to a particular audience. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah! Um, as I remember, that's part of what kind of allowed you to work on it at times was knowing it was sort of...at least for a while for you and that's how you wanted to be. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and I was sort of afraid that like it was going to burst my bubble or something (laughs). Um, because, ya know, people...and I knew...one thing is I know people are going to be nice to me because I had to read on my birthday (laughs) and it was like, so like, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...they weren't going to like you jerk (laughs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and then it was like well, I won't know what they actually think. Like I'll just have to like look at their facial expressions and see if they seem sincere. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Happy birthday. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I had a pretty miserable birthday and then I read. I ended up reading some things that I had written in April or May since I felt like I just had a little more time to make sure there were no glaring mistakes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:13:03.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I chose one of the like sort of funny passages that was more dialogue heavy cuz I still don't really feel comfortable sharing some of the more serious passages with people just because like I, I think it's harder to tell whether that is working. Whereas with humor I think there are certain like cues and you can just feel if you've found the right rhythm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so...it's all a little bit cowardly. Like I read humorous passages from the perspective of the sort of second to main character, the journalist...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...um, that were sort of similar in tone. And I had wanted to read something a little more dramatic for the second one, but I'm glad I didn't. People liked it and I had written it like 3 days before the reading. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was cool (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but...but the reading on my birthday was cool because people...I felt like they were being genuine when they said nice things (laughs). Really relieved. Um, and then like they had made a birthday cake for me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is like extra special since I'm like vegan and have a gluten sensitivity (laughs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...which makes it just impossible to feed in general but especially with like cake. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what did they? Can't imagine a few things. What did they do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, well the 27-year-old playwright is gluten-free and a good cook. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:14:47.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she made...um, she knows how to bake gluten-free so she used like an egg replacer...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and made this like really delicious chocolate cake. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh wow. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And after the readings like, they like surprised me with it, and it was so nice (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That sounds lovely. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was the best birthday I've had in years (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, it sounds like you felt well cared for and in the end really quite safe. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah in every way. And, I mean it was sort of amazing. It was a situation in which like every single person was like nice and supportive and ya know reasonably stable...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and that, you're like...you never had to be like (inaudible [00:15:43].0) this person could like blow up and say something awful because they don't have control of their tongue really. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: There was nothing like, which I feel like in their situations, there's, there's like someone...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...who uses their words that's going to say something upsetting, but, um, yeah it was...and it was cool too because I, I didn't really like talk about ya know the sort of stuff that's been going on the last couple years with all but like one person. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I felt like that didn't mean I had to like lie or be fake. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:16:25.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, there was a real relief like being a person who I felt was authentically me without, um, endangering myself in a sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I would think that was a really big deal and that it must have been very reassuring to feel like (pause) the difficulties with that in a sense have not just been about you. In other words that with a different group of people it felt very different. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah and somehow like their way of conversing and relating to people just seemed so much more like healthy and respectful. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, like I feel like with the grad students I hang out with, with like Sue, Katie, Kimberly, whoever, like there's just something sort of needling about it (laughs) and something like, um, sort of like intrusive and combative in a way. Um, but this is sort of like the timbre of the way they interact. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess as I think about it the feeling I kind of get from you as you describe it is as though there is it feels like (pause) they've got to kind of have your number and (pause) um, cut you down to size in a way that makes them feel comfortable. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and they're sneaky about it. Cuz they will try to cut you down to size. They try to cut themselves down to size and then expect you to reciprocate, and if you don't it's kinda weird. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like, um, so (inaudible at 00:18:32].7) cuz this shouldn't be either making yourself feel like shit or like feeling like a social failure because you're like rejecting the sort of overtures of how the conversation should go. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. The rules of the road kind of. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, like you feel all sort of evasive. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) yeah, and what, um...it was sort of remarkable. Like one of the women there, her name's Kimberly, um, it was like a 42-year-old mom is working on her first novel and ya know she had like a degree in writing and an MSA and had worked with like (inaudible [00:19:20].4) and like, so it's not like we were like in the same boat but we were both people who like hadn't published fiction...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and sort of we were a little nervous. Um, and she was like someone who worked in communications...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and just had this like motherly attitude toward everyone and she was, or is hilarious. Um, and like she and I got close over the course of the residency and just being around her was really good for me. Um, because her approach to humor, like sort of made me feel different about myself and my life. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel like that's sort of like a rare gift, like someone who can sort of shift your paradigm just by their energy and attitude and just way of talking. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, because like her humor didn't like make you feel like bad about yourself, but ya know I feel like she was like sort of like playing on my idiosyncrasies and neuroses in a way that just sort of made me feel like light about it instead of...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it was okay?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah! Like someone could like..</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Continue to have your foibles and it wasn't the end of the world kind of thing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um (pause) and, and it's funny. I guess it worked because that's just sort of her...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...her attitude, and she like really uses humor to sort of consume everything in a way that doesn't feel like avoidance, which is sort of rare. I feel like often humor feels like avoidance and like a shield. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:21:15.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and ya know I think it made more sense once I read her writing, which is amazing. You know she, she has an agent too who's interested and ya know she's totally going to get published. Like I overheard the director of the retreat say that to her too. Like it's not just me. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you can look around (laughs) (inaudible at 00:21:41].1) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs). She's very good. </p>

<p>CLIENT: She, yeah. And she's good in a way that's marketable too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, because, ya know, she's just so funny, but that...I feel like calling people marketable is dangerous because, ya know, it's always a statement that like the masses have poor taste...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible [00:22:05].8) intellectual writer (laughs). Yeah, and with her like she manages to be such a master of the right visual detail or ya know sort of subtle, subtle scene or double entendre of a line to end a scene with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But, um, she gets surprising stuff within this like really light humorous framework. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and those are really good things for me to read because I have been sort of conflicted about how to use humor in my writing. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, so I have like serious aims, but, uh, I think have a tendency to try to you know write funny scenes and interactions and I was worrying. It was like because I wanted to be liked or something. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that seems like a bad thing, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and plus like the writers I'm modeling my writing on...I have like 6 of them and they're all pretty serious. Um, ya know with humor here and there but not as much as like this writer Kimberly...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...has. Um, and I felt like much more comfortable embracing the humor. Um, and not thinking oh, well people aren't going to take me seriously, so I'm always, ya know...it's like too much of this voice (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:23:33.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause) and it was also nice finding a maternal figure who was more sort of like by default accepting and where I felt like, ya know, when I...when I was like neurotic it was going to be joked about. There wasn't going to be like a criticism or advice (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, that was very cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds very understanding. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I guess it wasn't like there were these big, um, sort of consequences for the things I was doing and, um, sometimes when I talk to my parents they're just so serious in their temperament and their world view and their beliefs, but, ya know, they really believe that like personal choice has weight and consequence and, um, ya know, like...they don't...I think they try to be easier on me because they know I don't like to be criticized (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, ya know, when they talk about other people, you know my mom will be like oh, my sibling's bad choices are coming home to roost. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, she used that phrase when I was there, and...like I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's, it's a (pause) sounds severe. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um (pause), yeah and ya know she also sometimes fixates on the future. They like...they really worry there's going to be like a water crises in Texas and the Southwest... </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in the next, ya know, 30 years. And also like an affordable energy crisis and so they're like, ya know, we're trying to plan our lives with these things in mind and ya know we don't have any retirement savings so we're thinking about whether we should like move to a cheaper place, but, ya know, then it'll be harder to find like new friends cuz we're old. Um, and ya know but we want to be on the same coast that you're on because we think there's going to be an energy crisis and it's going to be really hard to travel 30 years from now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [0:26:08.3]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's some stresses we have because, ya know, I have no idea what coast I'll be on. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) Or just around here what will happen and thinking about the future in sort of a pleasant (inaudible at 00:26:21].3).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Especially when it's presented like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Being such a morally catastrophic future isn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think it's somewhat likely, but the timing is so unpredictable. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like even if you moved to some place that has water and your family like what if the government decides to build a freeway right in the middle of your property (laughs). Not that that's likely to happen. No one seems to want like more infrastructure (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but like, ya know, some other country could decide to like poison our water supply. (laughs) There's lots of catastrophic things that could happen and cancel out your good decisions. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see, yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause), um (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I think it was very nice to be around people who, ya know, if not on the future in that way, were generally reassuring...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...it sounds like. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And supportive and positive. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and just sort of like the banter was really nice and they're like oh, ya know, when you get your book deal we'll have to go out for Dom Perignon (laughs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or it was like um, we should like, ya know, do a reading together when our books are out. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Ya know I mean that was so sort of like, such a nice fantasy to have in a group (laughs) of people. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt like they were sort of like healthy, happy-ish people. I mean, I don't know if I would say happy because I think, ya know, they all had like problems and a lot of them seemed to have some depression. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm [0:28:18.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But like, ya know, they'd found things and they'd been happy and devoted time to those things...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and like they lived lives that sounded appealing to me...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs) ...which is cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause) Yeah it sounds like, it sounds like they feel like your people. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it was really weird. Like pretty much all of them like exercised (laughs) and a lot of them would, ya know, get up early in the morning and go to bed reasonably early. And also they seemed like people who had healthy habits (inaudible at 00:29:03].3) (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs), but...and then I feel silly for feeling that (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I like don't particularly want to like model myself on them because I'm like well I don't want their lives. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But then, ya know, these people were people whose lives I actually wanted who were healthy (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right (chuckles). </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I've been to the gym twice since I've been back (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just amazing (laughs). Um, yeah and I've been like trying to go to bed early and get up early and I actually want to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like usually it's just something that I sort of have this idea that I should do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's not like I actually want to. But now I genuinely want to because I think about these other people doing it, so yeah, I'd like that (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (pause)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I makes me wonder whether any of your feeling about that has to do with kind of (pause) uh, like the (inaudible at 00:30:17].7) it. I mean I don't know if your parents are into getting to bed early and exercising and things like that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But, yeah. Um, I could imagine the sort of feel of how they would encourage you or be about that is quite different than how the people were at the workshop where I imagine like probably didn't even bring it up. Like they weren't trying to...I would guess they weren't trying to get you to do anything. That's just what they liked to do. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I don't feel I...like there's a sense of like personal responsibility and sort of a moral imperative to live a good, healthy life so you don't put a burden on others or, um, or whatever. And with the people here it was like they were doing it because it helps them do the things they wanted to do during the day...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and there was a much more like concrete applied rationale for doing things. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Like if I run in the morning, I'm less depressed in the afternoon when I'm trying to write. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh (laughs). Yeah, yeah, just like that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and in grad school I felt like people who got up early and went to the gym had this very like, sort of like Spartan ethos of, ya know, work hard and just be a like criticism machine and go to the gym because it, ya know, helps you do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and that wasn't like actually appealing to me, although I tried to get into it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but I don't know...the people at the retreat like it really wasn't some sort of like big deal or like part of their identity...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in a way that it is for a lot of people. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:32:09.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, unlike, ya know, my friends who like are on like weight loss regimens that are sort of like, ya know, that become part of their identity. Like I think I was sort of afraid of having something become a part of my identity that was lame (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um (laughs)...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, but when it's like not really a big deal and you just do it because it's like convenient for writing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, again I guess not so heavy, like you said before. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah like I didn't realize how like heavy everyone seems to be who I find myself around normally. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and you'd think like a bunch of artists would be really like self-involved and dramatic, and I was a little worried about that, but that wasn't the way it was at all. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it was partly because a lot of them have had success and have had to sort of professionalize what they do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And, um...so it isn't the sort of like self-serious, like (inaudible at 00:33:32].8), like young (inaudible at 00:33:32].8). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, um, and I think before I went I had had a tendency to feel like my best writing came when I would like stay up really late and like write for like long hours through the night. And I did that sometimes when I...I mean I did stay up late a lot while I was there and I think partly because I was so nervous about the reading I had a hard time sleeping, but um, I also had days when I would get up early and write more calculated things that were...especially like the more humorous themes, um, that I felt were like just as good in a different way, and so probably like my favorite time and so I write (inaudible at 00:34:28].9) like late-night inspiration or like immersional times, but like the morning and afternoon writing like I'm feeling very happy with, with that style, ya know. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you got (inaudible at 00:34:52].1) sound much happier.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And less weighed down. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah and I'm probably happier than I have been since college (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. That's terrific. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And, ya know, I'm getting (laughs) worried about whether I'll be able to keep it up. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [0:35:12.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I think since I come...since I came back I've been a little bit (inaudible at 00:35:19].0) and I've been like working on the novel and the short story and just trying...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to like see if I can maintain the feeling and get into a pattern. Um, I'd say I'm really scared to lose that since it's been so long since I had it (laughs).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh, yeah and I kinda wish I could just move home for several months and finish the novel and see if anyone would pay me for it (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But, I don't think being at home would be good for the novel (laughs), so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...not really a good solution. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because of being around your parents?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah (pause) um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And away from Jeff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel bad because I know they don't like try on purpose to be so serious but that's just who they are (laughs). They grew up in families where like religion and personal responsibility were the, ya know, the most important things and that makes for serious people (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. (pause) Yeah, so it doesn't seem like a good option. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No (laughs). Uh, although it sort of stresses me out to think like about how long it will probably be until I actually finish the novel. Um, because I looked back at a lot of the things I've written and decided that they all needed to be rewritten (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is a little daunting, ya know. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: People frequently ask like how far along are you. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like well, I just realized that I want to rewrite most of what I've written (laughs) so far...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...so I'm kind of back at square one in some sense. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, I'm not really at square one. Not at square one. (laughs) (pause) Um, I mean my vision for the whole thing is much clearer than it was when I went there (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. In my (inaudible at 00:37:59].3) is that actually it's pretty hard to know quite where you're at in writing a novel. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) Um, yeah and it's frustrating to admit. I mean right now I do sort of know that I'm not very far along since I want to rewrite...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (laughs)...pretty much everything I wrote before like June...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...of this year (laughs). Um, but I mean I have a vague detailed outline now that Kimberly convinced me to make with Post-It Notes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and having that visual with like a scene-by-scene breakdown is really cool. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And it does sort of make me feel like at least I know where I'm going and what I need to do. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. [0:38:52.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think that's really comforting. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and I started working on a short story that has nothing to do with the novel when I came back. Which is kind of amusingly a horror story set in a rural town. (laughs)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like hmm, interesting thing to be inspired to write as soon as I get back. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) Yeah, set in Somerville. [0:39:13.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, um, and it's sort of fun writing in a genre that I've never really written...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in before and that's totally different from the novel. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup. </p>

<p>CLIENT: And that I can conceive of like publishing as a standalone because it doesn't require sort of other info.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, yeah, this summer was more fulfilling than anything I've done in years (laughs)...maybe ever (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's fantastic. [0:39:47.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. If only it made money (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might. </p>

<p>CLIENT: One day maybe (laughs)...especially if I keep the humor aspect in there (laughs)...I think that's much more likely to make someone want to buy it (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) Yeah, I'm, ya know, at a stage now where it's imperative that I face reality and do other...check up on other things, and still do it, cuz like, ya know, writing fiction makes me much more motivated to live a good life. Cuz it's, ya know, something more to live for than when I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...am doing things that are like more of a struggle...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and less fun (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Unless like, ya know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And happy's worth a lot it seems to me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it just didn't really seem like an option until I moved to the residency. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean (pause) I see it as not clear if you can have all the things that made you happy while you were there, I mean that's a big deal that's out there. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah and I'm, ya know, going to apply to residencies for next summer. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hmm. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, and it's sort of comforting to know that whatever happens between now and then, like hopefully I'll get in somewhere and have something to look forward to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:41:46.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Cuz it is something you can do like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: ...a month out of pretty much every year. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. </p>

<p>CLIENT: If you get in (laughs). </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, you know that's always the hard part, but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You did this year. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I did this year (laughs). Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We can stop for now. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. [0:42:06.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, but I'm glad it was such a good experience. That's terrific. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thanks. Yeah, yeah it was. It was like nice to finally have some things go right. Um, and I have, let's see a check...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Did I send you a bill? I forget. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. I did some billing last week but I...okay. Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now I forget. Should I factor the taping or should I not factor it in until later when it...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, factor it in. </p>

<p>CLIENT: So, one hundred?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm forgetting.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let's see. I had been submitting to your insurance as well. Um, why don't I...let me send you a bill. Why don't you write me a check next week. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, I will do that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, and then we can just...we'll do it...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Um, cool, so I will see you then. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, take care. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. [0:43:40.1]</p>

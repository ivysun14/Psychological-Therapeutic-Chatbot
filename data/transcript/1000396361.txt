<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Uhm, I, I just went from thinking first of, uhm, something that struck me uhm, I mean, I've been aware of it for several days but uhm, I, remember a while ago I was worrying over, uhm, a wart that I thought I was getting on my finger.  And I was recalling other times when I had them on my fingers.  Well, the thing that I've been aware of lately is I think it would be a plantar's wart on my foot.  And again, I'd had them before.  Uhm, I had several.  And I think that, uhm, I think all of them were taken care of.  I had X-ray (stumbles over word) X-ray treatments for a while and then they were taken care of.  But I was just thinking about it today because it's now getting uncomfortable.  And the thing that I'd noticed on my finger — maybe it's still there — but I'd, after being very aware of it for several days and worrying about it I, I haven't checked it but, uhm, I just know I haven't been thinking about it lately.  And it's as if it's gone as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<p>Uhm, I don't know, so I guess what, I'm just wondering if this plantar's wart is something that'll come and go and, and what it is if — if it is like that then I'm I don't know, sort of causing it, I guess is what I'm wondering.  Uhm, but then the next thing I thought, uhm, and I haven't (clears throat) thought about this very — I mean I didn't think long on this just now because I went into thinking something else.  But, uhm, I thought of what had seemed to be a very important question to me yesterday and the day before.  And yet I think yesterday I felt as if I'd worked out an answer to it or, uhm, I'm not sure but it just doesn't seem like it was a question to me at the end.  But ag—, it was again about, ah, that, that whole question I had about sharing and particularly that incident when I was thinking of something and had that initial feeling of sharing it with you and then cut it off.  And, uhm, well, I, I just, I don't know, given things that came up yesterday too, it seems like maybe I'd forgotten already to be antagonistic.  I haven't completely forgotten yesterday.</p>

<p>But, uhm, well, I probably want to get back to this but the thing I thought immediately after thinking of that question and the fact that somehow I had the feeling it wasn't a question by the end yesterday, uhm, was, I think first wondering if you were going to tell me about the time for next year, which would again be sort of, I guess, a way to — I mean I want to know the time — but it would be a way to also wonder if you were going to tell me I am coming back.  And, uhm, and then I started thinking well, I wonder if, uhm, since you hadn't been absolutely certain of the time when you had brought it up before, what if something has happened and you now can give me the earlier time that I had preferred, which would mean I could come right after work.  And I began imagining that, imagining, uhm, well, not, not that you were going to do it but thinking what if you did and then imagining how it would be if you did.  Or, I mean just in terms of getting here.  And, uhm, —</p>

<p>And I had — well, I'd been I guess sort of kidding myself that I'd accepted that you couldn't change the time and in fact it had to be the later time because I've, sometimes when I've come down here, I've thought well, next year I'll be coming at such and such a time.  It's, I guess,</p>

<p>almost as if I'm preparing myself.  Uhm, but, I don't know, just now, I got the feeling maybe I really haven't accepted it.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, uhm, the time will be, eh, at least to start with, 5 o'clock.  It's conceivable I might have to make it 10 minutes later than that.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But we'll start out at 5 o'clock each day.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  And that's right after labor day?</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yeah, it's the, starting on the 5th, I believe.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>(Pause) Well, uhm, (sniffle) I don't, it seems like what I think next, I mean it's, that was what I had anticipated.  I didn't know exactly what time but essentially that was what I anticipated.  And, uhm, thinking about what I'd just been saying, well, I don't know whether it's a question of accepting it or, uhm, I guess, I guess, the thing is I don't like it, I want it to be at the earlier time.  And I haven't stopped wanting it to be at the earlier time and not liking it at that time.  Uhm, so I don't know whether that means I can't a—, I haven't accepted it or what.  But uhm, but then just, ah, after you said that or just thinking about next fall starting again, I got that feeling again that I had the other day when I was thinking of coming back in the fall, uhm, of everything starting at once.  I'm not sure exactly what day I have to start in at school but, uhm, I don't know, I, it's as if, if I knew I could come back — because I could come earlier than after, right after labor day uhm, but I probably won't — uhm, but I, it's almost as if I have the feeling I need a few days just to sort of prepare myself.  And I don't know exactly what for, for, except it seems like it's almost steel myself.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I keep mixing it up with thinking well, maybe it has something to do with, uhm, the fact that the question of who will take care of FSO is not settled, although I've arranged that Mrs. CDB will be available if I need her.  And I know, I'm quite sure in fact I'll speak to z,,,, before I go — but I'm quite sure I can bring FSO there again if I needed to so uhm, I think I was even less certain when I went away less summer.  But, uhm, I think I'm confusing the issue by thinking it has something to do with being unsettled about who's going to take care of FSO because I really don't think, uhm, I mean those are two people I'd feel comfortable leaving her with, even though it might not be the greatest convenience for me.  And, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What's really unsettled?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, it seems like in the context of what I'd been saying, my getting my way.  Or that I'm not.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yeah, you see you want coming to analysis to be, as you said a while back, comfortable, convenient.  You don't want it to disrupt your life.  You don't want it to change anything.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, that makes me think of uhm, because I've almost lo—, I've completely lost touch with the frame of mind I was in, I guess it was may, or whenever I made the decision to work next year.  And, uhm, but that made me think of something, I guess, that had been concerning me in the spring anyway.  And then it seemed to be on my mind when I was trying to decide.  But that I felt I'd become, well, making coming here the whole thing of the day.  And anything else I did was worked around coming here.  And, uhm it seemed very major to me to be coming here.  Not that it had anything to do with my feeling I was working at something and changing it but just simply this is what I did.  And it was, there was a feeling of being comfortable having a certain pattern and, uhm, I don't know, it seemed like at that time — I don't, I don't feel this frame of mind now — but at that time, I wanted to break that.  I mean there must have been other things too, I'm sure that wasn't the only feeling I had about it but, uhm, —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But what's the obvious way to break it?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  To actually actively do something to change.  But, I don't know, it seemed like I couldn't unless I set it up so that, uhm, well, I don't know, I mean it seems like what I, what I was thinking is setting it up so it wasn't the major thing of my day and then it would be un—, inconvenient so I'd feel, well, if I'm going to come in this inconvenient way, I'd better do something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  No, but you were still having the fantasy earlier before I told you what time, that I really would maybe come through and make it convenient for you after all.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So you're still thinking along those lines.  (Pause) What really strikes is how the things you're now talking about completely ignore some of the things that we were talking about yesterday and what I said.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  (Pause) Well that brings back to me the feeling I had yesterday of wanting to have a recording so I wouldn't forget.  Which I was denying by the end of yesterday when it began to be, uhm, clear it had something to do with being a substitute for really wanting your penis.  And now I feel it again.  And the only other thing I recall from, uhm, well I don't know, it seems like maybe — of what you said other than about the recording is, uhm, your pointing out my setting up fights.  But, I don't know, is the same thing that happened yesterday over the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What's your idea about the recording and me?  What do you think that means to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) I'm having a hard time thinking about it because, uhm, (pause) I don't know, it's almost like I, well, I am, I guess, thinking I don't understand your question, which seems kind of silly.  And then what I thought was of, uhm, — I don't know if I thought of something first — but of anyway, FSO having a bad fall today.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  So it's clear, then, you think that the recording, some way, is connected with, eh, my getting hurt.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I think what I first thought of, too, was, uhm, well, that if I could take a recording away — I was thinking of it one way, but really probably is another — uhm, it would be like taking — because it would be of your voice — it would be like taking something of you away.  But then that could either be because I don't want to leave you so therefore I want to take something of you away, like your voice, or it could be simply that it's, it is true that I associate it or substitute it in my mind for your penis.</p>

<p>And, uhm, — then, but I don't know, I just thought of this now, that it's almost as if the way I've been thinking well, yesterday and I think I was sort of thinking that way, uhm, well, I guess it was earlier yesterday when I had thought of the day before yesterday, uhm, that feeling of I had to be here in order to remember things or to be able to think of them and concentrate on what we'd been talking about and to retain any understanding I got.</p>

<p>And then I thought of, well, this recording would be the way to do it.  And, uhm, ah, I'm losing what I was thinking.  But anyway it's almost as if, uhm, well, I mean, on those terms clearly for me to feel I'm getting anywhere to have the recording but then it would be, if it is symbolic of your penis, then it would be, uhm, I guess, uhm, well I don't know, it just sound terr—, I mean I thought of it but then now it just doesn't make sense.  Uhm, that somehow I would see it as being somewhat successful in what I'm wanting or — (pause)</p>

<p>Well, I just started thinking of something else from yesterday that, uhm, I'm thinking of it as a stage that I rea—, I mean at one point, where I was questioning it yesterday.  And I think I got beyond this point, too uhm, but I was recalling again the other thing that I had remembered from yesterday of your pointing out how I will set up fights.  And, uhm, and then I was just thinking of the way I was distinguishing between setting them up with you and setting them up with MSCZ as if with MSCZ, very often I wanted the end result, uhm, that he would force me to.  Well, I guess I thought at first that that's what I was doing with you in wanting you to sort of break through my resistance to changing.  And uhm, (pause) well, I'm not recalling at all.  Seems like what I'm not recalling is the full extent of my respon—, my participation in this or responsibility for the fighting or, uhm, — (Silence)</p>

<p>The next thing I was thinking is, uhm, (sighs during pause) well, I, I think the way I was thinking it is not quite what it really is but, uhm, I, I think I was thinking of the fact that here I am, not even at the point I'd reached yesterday.  I'd forgotten some of the things and can't put it together again.  And then I thought it's almost like I want to ask you, "Doesn't this drive you crazy, that sort of I go forward a bit and then go back more?"  Uhm, and I suppose at first I was thinking that (analyst laughs first and she joins) —</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Is that as transparent to you as it is to me?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, well, I wanted to drive you crazy.  (Laughs)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Of course!</p>

<p>PATIENT:  But first I was thinking, Oh, I wanted you to say, "Oh no!" Sort of, "I understand," or something.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Yeah, it's part of your whole way of rendering all my efforts useless, rendering me impotent.  You're showing me what you think of the things I say.  You forget them.  You destroy them.  And you really would like to drive me up the wall, frustrate me totally.  (Silence) (cough) See, the equation, I think the recording comes in because you made it plain a while back that you think for me the important thing about, you know, is that, is research and experiment, what you were told at the beginning.  And eh, if you can make me fail then you have really hurt me where you think it hurts most.  And that's really for you equivalent to castrating me.  It's an indirect way to do what you'd really like to do, which is what you would like to have done to that guy in the movie.  It's what you'd like to do to me, it's what you'd like to do to MSCZ and most men, as far as I can tell.  And you're doing it in all these indirect ways every day.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  (Silence) Well, I'm thinking of something along the line, I can't seem to get very clear but I was thinking of it, uhm, right before you spoke just now, too, of, uhm, well, I guess right before you spoke I was thinking of it more specifically as just, in, in terms of my trying to, my resisting right now, before vacation starts.  And, uhm, and then suddenly getting quite concerned over will I be able to pick up or, uhm, will you take me back to this point in the fall.  Because I really don't want it to stop here.  Except right now that's what I'm doing as much as I can, is to hold myself right here.  And I mean, I know I'm responsible except I get, I get this way of thinking about it as if I'm not, as if somehow I'm powerless to do what's really for my best interest.</p>

<p>Uhm, and then it, the same kind of thought occurred to me after you pointed out the more general implications of what I'm doing and, uhm, because of, I don't know, I wasn't thinking specifically what would it be like if I actually was able to castrate you and MSCZ and any man I came across.  But, but somehow I just had this feeling I really wouldn't like having — well, I don't know whether maybe it's just the fear of what if I actually did do that.  But it seemed to me it was more just thinking I really wouldn't like to have that power.  Uhm, except I al-,, I always go around wanting to fight and, and resist and get as close as I can to it except I don't really want it.  And then, I think and by fighting and resisting and so forth, I'm, I don't know, well, I'm not following my best interests.  And, uhm, — (pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Nonetheless, it's very satisfying to you.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Yeah, I find that very hard to admit but I think it's true because I, every once in a while get sort of a, uhm, a moment where I'm not controlling my thoughts enough so I realize it is.  But — (pause) well, what I th—, what I think of as a comparison is, uhm, in this mystery I've been reading, uhm, I'm not sure if there's going to be another twist to it that isn't clear to me right now, but apparently, as, as it's turning out right now, the person who was killed, killed himself as a tremendous plan of revenge against somebody that he thought was, I guess, mainly just, uhm, having an affair with his wife.  And he was an unbalanced person anyway.  And, uhm, apparently when he thought this — and it was untrue — he built up this terrific hatred for the man.  And then his killing himself was part of trying to trap the man into being caught as his murderer.  And he felt, when he sent the man off on part of this plan and then he killed himself after he sent the, he thought he'd sent the man off, uhm, he, the man actually was able to save himself because he saw this person's face as he drove off.  And it was, uhm, here he is about to kill himself but he, he was sort of madly triumphant and, uhm, enjoying the thought of this kind of revenge and of destroying this other person.  And yet, he's going to destroy himself to do it.  (Silence)</p>

<p>And the, I mean what I think next is just simply that by trying to castrate you in this way, ah, I'm refusing the help that I came here for.  Or, uhm, maybe what I'm not fully, well, admitting I guess it would be, or, uhm, what you had just pointed out, too.  That I do get pleasure out of thinking that I have been successful or, just in doing it.  And, uhm, because, because generally when I think about it, it just seems like it's ah, a crazy thing to be doing because I'm not counting into it perhaps the extent of the pleasure.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Well, I k—, I think, been thinking this too today every once in a while, which maybe is just another way of saying you've made no effect on me, I don't know, I think of it somewhat differently but then I wonder about it.  Uhm, because I keep thinking of well, if I go away, as it seems like I'm going to, because I don't see how one more day can suddenly break through all this or make me one more day I will be able to stop myself from doing this or whatever, uhm, then I anticipate that the summer will be, uhm, without coming here, just uhm, well, I don't know how to think of it except sort of, I, I, somehow I'm pulling very much in myself and, uhm, and keeping a balance that will keep MSCZ happy.  But, uhm, well, I don't like the image.  I don't know, uhm, because that's all what I've been saying I want to do but, uhm, (pause) well, I don't know whether it's I'm thinking of it as coming here has made some difference even though I've been mainly striving to keep things balanced exactly as they have been.  Uhm, because if, if I get too tense over things or if things are getting beyond my control to some extent, talking about things here then I can reali—, I don't know, somehow it's almost as if I've been using coming here and further understanding to keep the balance.  And that I'm afraid not coming it'll be harder, I guess, maybe this summer or, uhm, something will be harder, I'm not sure just what.  Or that without you to fight then I'll just have to concentrate on MSCZ, maybe that's it, I don't know.  But then I imagine coming in the fall and being very, I don't know, having a very hard shell around me.  And, uhm, as if it will be starting all over again.  (Pause)</p>

<p>ANALYST:  What strikes me is that eh, the times when you seem most really in touch or excited or concrete or vivid have been when you were telling me about the movie "Frenzy", when you were concrete in describing what was going on z,,,,, you know, telling me something you were really seeing in your mind's eye, almost.  And today, it's when you were telling me about the, eh, plot of the eh, story in the book as though the things that really deeply involve you and interest you, that you keep denying, are rape and murder and destruction.  And part of this balance is to keep all that stuff cool, shove it all aside.  But those are the things that eh, you have a deep interest in.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.  Well, this comes to my mind again and has, uhm, in the last few days I think it has even though, uhm, maybe I was just always keeping it pushed back — but again, of, of thinking of what happened with FNAO BBK and her husband, what, her killing her husband.  And, uhm, I guess it's a curiosity about it.  (Clears throat) And, anyway just the fact I keep thinking of it every o—, now and then for so, such a long period and was very struck by it when I first read it that — I mean it was the same kind of way, I think.  (Pause) But, I don't know, what, seems to me that what's been happening is I can think these things and I'm not really, when you point them out, I don't think I'm feeling that I'm denying them.  Or, uhm, I mean, in some way I know they're true but yet, uhm, I don't know, it's uhm, it seems like somehow I'm really, I'm really not, ah, associating myself with it.  (Pause)</p>

<p>Or at least, I mean because, because the movie or the, the book or any, any time murder or rape comes up, uhm, it's a vicarious thing.  I mean I suppose I was thinking about FNAO BBK was too, but uhm, somehow with FN—, thinking about FNAO BBK, it's a much more ah, somehow closer thing.  Because I think what I'm always thinking is I wonder if I could ever do that or what, what would it be like for me to do what she did?  Or, uhm, I mean that's seems like that's the closest I come to really, maybe it's admitting or, I don't know what but what I'm thinking that when I'm thinking of all these destructive things, well, in the case of FNAO BBK, I, it's, it's to, uhm, be killing MSCZ.  And, and, uhm, I guess all of this is directed toward all men but — (Pause)</p>

<p>Or maybe — because I'm not saying this exactly the way I'm feeling it — maybe it's more I'm saying these things or agreeing with you when you point things out without letting it really affect me, realiz—, letting the realization of it really affect me.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  That's right.  (Pause) So in one and the same, you know, when you're doing that, you're doing two things.  You're being obedient, —</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Mm.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  But you're also fighting, thwarting me.  You're doing both at the same time.</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I just thought of a question that I think I've been feeling it sometimes lately but not, I didn't ever think of it quite this way — uhm, when you've pointed out other things being just for that purpose that I'm doing, uhm, the question I just thought of now I think was, uhm, — and maybe I'm doing two things again uhm, and, and I keep trying to think is it one or the other — but, uhm, whether this thwarting of you, in effect not letting you have any influence, is just to fight you the way I want to fight any man or if it's because you're trying to make me give up something that I keep thinking I want to hang on to.  But I guess it's really part of the same thing.</p>

<p>ANALYST:  Well, our time's up.</p>

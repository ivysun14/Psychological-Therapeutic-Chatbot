<p>(00:02:00)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I have to leave like a little late and I have to leave about five minutes early just to get to work on time. I'm just going to set timer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to be in early today?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No because we didn't watch that other film this week.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So they need me there at eight. I just told them I would be five minutes late, so. (inaudible00:02:53) there. So if I leave at five of I'll be good. (Pause) So Georgia went well. Mostly well. As well as I kind of hoped it would go. So that was total relief. I (pause) um, my dad was the absolute best I've ever seen him. (pause) I know that he's on some (pause) anti-depressants. He's um, mostly for his bipolar and so (pause) it's working I guess. So I mean it was, it was ... it was like I'd never met him before. (chuckle) (pause) I mean not that extreme but like it was him (pause) just like totally (inaudible00:04:02) like totally (pause) you know he was really like he'd show up early in the afternoon. Which normally like he would show up usually like come around for dinner. I went and hung around with my brother in the afternoon he'd hang out at the beach with us and he you know he's really engaging like asking questions about our life which is like, I mean huge.</p>

<p>(00:04:26)</p>

<p>CLIENT: He would have I mean sort of interest or he was like throwing the football with Chris and was just totally just not ... my grandmother would try to like bait him. She's a little bit evil. And she would say things to him and he would just (pause) like sit there and kind of let it roll off and then you know kind of like you know give each other a look like, "Oh." And just have our own kind of moment about it and it would be done. And one night we went to dinner, just him and Chris and me and my grandmother and she was like (laugh) kind of dragging her feet, she didn't want to (inaudible00:05:00). And he was the one like, "All right mom come on. Like these guys want to go do their own thing. It was like un ... unreal. It was unbelievable. (pause) And it was just a huge relief. Like I just felt so ... I mean I'm still nervous about spending more time with him in Massachusetts because I don't trust that these things will last for a longtime. But it was a relief to see that for now he's doing well and that um, maybe (pause) that I can ... that I can be around him and I can feel okay and that ... like I was really confident around the whole family the whole time which was really unusual for me I think in part because my dad was so even keeled and predictable. That it made me feel safe enough to feel confident and be okay and just ... like let some of the things my grandmother said kind of slide.</p>

<p>(00:06:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And um, you know I don't expect that maybe will always be the case but it was good for this trip because ... like if anything this weekend was just nice to have with my dad because I have never had anything like that before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, (pause) every, every experience I had had with him in Georgia had been awful. And this was not even close. So (pause) it was good. It was nice. (pause) I mean every experience I've had in my life with him has really been (pause) very touch and good but this was the first one that I just felt like ... I left and I felt like I can even point to a thing with him that would have ... it was just amazing. (pause) So you know? I'm really happy about that. I'm trying to just (pause) I'm feeling that also that I'm not putting too much weight into it. I'm not, you know ... I know that ... I'm not trying to be pessimistic but I'm also not really like crazy optimistic where I think like, "This is dad now." (pause) I'm just trying to be realistic in the fact that like that experience was great and (pause) um, if we ever want that in the future I'm thrilled. And if things you know take a turn (pause) that's like I'm just really happy that that happened.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>(00:07:45)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I really feel like (pause) um (pause) no matter what happens I will always have had that weekend with him. And so I'm really happy with that. (pause) I just feel really good. (pause) I don't know what he's on but it's great. (pause) My grandmother on the hand is a little less great. (pause) She's like she ... I don't know she's so weird. I mean like (pause) you know so whenever my brothers come to Georgia they get a limo (pause) at like she comes in the limo ... it's an hour and fifteen from her apartment to the airport. So she gets this big limo for them and she comes in the limo. She has champagne and the whole thing and granted our flight got in at um, midnight on Thursday but ... so she sends a town car and um, it's an hour and half to the airport and so we take the town car an hour and a half back and the driver's like, "All right so it's going to be ninety bucks." And I was just kind of like, "Oh all right you know like it's fine we'll put it on the credit card." But immediately I was like ... like my brothers every time they come get like the royal treatment, like everything rolled out. And it's not a big deal because we're adults. So we can pay for our own car. (pause) But I mean immediately like that gets in my head like, "How did you ever know what my brothers get when they come down here?" And so ... I don't know, so whatever (pause) you know Chris's (inaudible00:09:50) like it's fine. That's why we have a credit card like we'll live.</p>

<p>(00:09:54)</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) so uh (pause) anyway you know we all have a nice time and we're ... my aunt and uncle are down there; my dad's brother, his wife and their three kids who are kind of younger. They're you know in middle school and elementary school. And you know she came down and spent the whole first day at the beach with us. A family that I grew up babysitting for; who I was really close too. It's (pause) my grandmother's friends son who's in his forties now but when I was growing they were in their like twenties or thirties and they lived next door to us. And I would spend a lot of time ... I mean I would go on vacation with. I used there house kind of like ... I would spend the night there probably at least twice a week and just spend a lot of time with them.</p>

<p>(00:10:52)</p>

<p>And so they were down visiting my grandmother's friends, his mom. And so I like went over there and we all had lunch together and it was really nice and I got to see everybody and (pause) they're really good about like checking in and saying like, "Are you okay?" Like don't, you know ... just make sure I remember not to take anything personally. And so it was nice to see them immediately and just have them kind of say like, you know, "Just relax and don't let her get to you." (pause) And yeah she was good for the most part; for the first couple of days she was good, you know then five o'clock hits and the cocktails start and they don't stop and she goes at one or two in the morning and she over ... you know she's (pause) sixty-nine, seventy. And so you just don't ... you know (pause) it's just (inaudible00:11:50). (pause) And so she gets drunk pretty easily and then she just starts going. And it's like she would just like everything to her is an insult and everything is something that she has to like ... she has some sort of retort to everything. To even my little cousin Jessie who's this twelve-year-old girl. So like it's crazy this tiny condo there's three bathrooms and my grandmother (pause) "Why would you say this is tiny? What's tiny? What's tiny about this?" It's like she's twelve... she was just saying condos are smaller than houses. You know but everything is an insult, everything is (pause) ... and you know my aunt; who's her daughter-in-law like the nicest lady but everything like she has to get these jobs that do any job she can. "Oh my God. How do you guys all put up with this all the time?" Because they come down multiple times a winter. And then they see her all summer long. "How do you guys do this?"</p>

<p>(00:12:57)</p>

<p>And like ... I don't know. (pause) So you know it's the first or the second night she started with me about you know, "We felt (inaudible00:13:10). Why was that? What happened there?" And I just didn't say anything. Or it was her friend, the mother of the family that I'm close too. (pause) She told us this long drawn out story where she starts crying about how she knew everything about my life because I was close to her daughter-in-law and she would tell all their friends all the things that she knew that my grandmother didn't know and that ... you know and my grandmother ... and (pause) and you know and that just killed me, "M". That killed me that you did that to me and went oh. And you and this going on and on. (pause) And normally I would have gotten really upset and probably started crying (pause) but Chris was sitting with me and so for some reason that just made me, you know just made me feel more secure and I just didn't really react and I didn't really say anything. I just kind of let her finish her story and then um, I just said, "You know yeah I understand why you would be hurt by that." And then we just kind of moved on. But then the next night after we were all out to dinner (pause) she started yelling at my uncle out of nowhere; who she never gets in a fight with, ever. He's like the golden boy to her. It was like she had Tourette's, like she would just start yelling out of nowhere. Swearing, he has the worst attitude; it was the weirdest thing. I had never seen her do that. Usually it's a good discussion and she gets (inaudible00:14:44) up. But we were just watching this television show and she would just start yelling.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:14:51)</p>

<p>Oh my God. So they got up to go to bed and then she started to deal with me of course again. Why we fell apart ... we did that and that was terrible and who did that why? Whose fault was that? Whose fault was that? Trying to get me to react and say that it was me and that I, you know whatever? (pause) Take some blame I guess. (pause) And so I just didn't say anything and then when she finished I said, "Well you know I'm here now. So I'd like to focus on that and then you know have a good time this weekend and go forward." (pause) And she just dropped it. But it was like a good solid ten minutes (chuckle) and I wanted to say, "Oh lady, come on here." So that just ... I mean that was our last night and then we had a, you know most of the day the next day. And I was just happy that we had left then because usually when she starts it just gets worse every week. And so I was relieved that that was the last night and that (pause) You know she ... earlier in the night she had been ... I could see her at dinner talking Chris's ear off about, "You know you're always at her mom's side of the family and you've ... and she was talking his ear off at dinner about that. That's it. (pause) She just can't help herself. But it's so awkward and like how do you (pause) I don't know it's just like ... I mean you just have sit through it and let her finish? But (pause) I can't really put up with it. I don't like it. I don't like the feeling of it.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:16:26)</p>

<p>Enough of it. (pause) I don't know it was (pause) like to me even though these instances make me think like, "That was really great. It was a lot of fun." Because I had a great time with my cousins. It was great to get to know them. My little cousin who is six asked me the first day if I was his cousin. Like they just don't know me at all. (pause) And he's kind of like goofy. You know like (inaudible00:16:54) don't know what he's talking about. I was like, "Look you generally want to know if I was his cousin. He didn't know." And that was part of the reason that I, you know that I want to be ... these kids don't really know me and then the last day like ... I'm like (inaudible00:17:07). (inaudible00:17:08) they're my cousins. I have little girl cousins are like chatting about these books that they're reading and like having we like had built this relationship in these four days and it was nice. And you know I didn't want (pause) to leave and that was why leaving ... this is why I wanted to come.</p>

<p>(00:17:26)</p>

<p>But then the other side of it was my grandmother. It was like, "This makes me not want to (pause) this makes me not what to come." There were these really great, positive ... just these two evening can just take that whole thing. I mean it doesn't for me because (pause) it didn't get to the same level of crazy that it has in the past. But (pause) I don't know it's just unbelievable to me. It's unbelievable to me that everybody still goes around all the time. Like how do you ... how do you ... you guys are stronger people than me. And even Chris said ... he and I went out after a dinner one evening; just to two of us and he was like, "I've been thinking this whole weekend how hard this must have been for you growing up." Because you're ... I'm so sensitive. I'm so sensitive to everything and he was saying like I just ... I'm realizing how hard that must have been because in your family it seems like a lot of things that are said are really harsh. (laughs) And that's why I always ended up crying and I always ended up really upset. And really easily. Much more easily than anybody else in my family because that's my nature. I just can't ... I'm just not as tough. And so ... and I just ... I don't know. It's just ... it's much harder for me.</p>

<p>(00:18:59)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is that what you attribute this too that you're just not as tough as everybody else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah because they ... like it doesn't bother them ... they just don't ... they don't just like ... they just roll their eyes. And that's what I was kind of doing this time. But I'm just ... I'm really sensitive. (Laugh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like you were treated much worse than everybody else.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah there are certain things that I get a harder time for ... (pause) and just um ... and you know and like Chris was saying ... I was saying to him like, "How are my little cousins around all of this?" Like I have girl cousins who are twelve and Fifteen who were down this time and I have two other girl cousins who are twenty-one and eighteen. And their family doesn't come down for it anymore because of an incident that happened with my girl cousin who is twenty-one. When she was like fifteen um ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What incident?</p>

<p>CLIENT: My grandmother ... my aunt; my dad's sister walked into my grandmother's bedroom and my grandmother had my cousin's arm twisted behind her back and was ... I don't know what she was doing. But they got into some argument and my grandmother got upset with her and twisted her arm behind her back and my brother Alex, the one who's nineteen was down with them and my aunt just said, "Everybody pack your stuff, we're going. We're leaving right. We're not coming ... we're just ... I'm not coming back down here again." And so they all packed up and left.</p>

<p>(00:20:32)</p>

<p>They haven't been back down since. And so they don't come around really either. But um ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So your cousins were there at ... one set is your father's brother's?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah the youngest. (pause) And they ... I mean they're just the sweetest kids and (pause) you know my aunt is a really good mom. She's really tied up with them. Of course my grandmother gives her a hard time for that. Like (pause) they got, you know my uncle and my grandmother who never ... have never gotten into a big argument; they got into I guess a huge argument a couple months ago and my dad was around. That my aunt is too (pause) is too attentive to them, to the kids. That my twelve-year-old cousin should be more independent and should be doing stuff on her own. And it's like whether that's true or not, I mean it doesn't (pause) I don't think it like (pause) should ever escalate to an argument of like a screaming match, like you know. And I just don't think that that's really my grandmother's business. Whether my aunt is too attentive to her kids. And whether my twelve-year-old cousin is independent enough or not ... my aunt Judy was talking to me about it and that particular child's personality is just one who likes to be around adults more and she just ... she has a little harder time socially and so her mom has, you know treats her a little bit differently because of her personality. And it's like you know that's how they're going to do it in their family, you know.</p>

<p>(00:22:16)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is your father's brother's wife?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. She's the school psychologist at their school as well and so I think she is around a lot and I think she does (pause) but she's not this like crazy (inaudible00:22:30) like I see her around her kids and she's like (pause) you know (pause) when I see here around them I think like, "That seems completely perfect to me." Like you know they get themselves ready to go to the beach. They get their own sunscreen on. They make sure they have all there things they need. You know like it's not like she's in there like combing their hair ... you know like they seem to be doing everything appropriately for their age.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you're basing this on your grandmother's criticism?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like it sounds like your taking criticism seriously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I was trying to look for the validity in it and I just can't ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like your grandmother is crazy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She's crazy. (Chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So yes let's talk about it. Like it seems like you know she's crazy but somehow you're like taking what she's saying seriously.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has this authoritative role in our family I guess. And I guess you know because of that everybody does take a little bit of what she says seriously because she ... I mean like (pause) everybody's kind of like (pause) I don't know I mean (pause) she just gets so clear that she's in charge, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>(00:22:30)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Of what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean well holds the purse strings. (pause) And so everybody kind of bows down to her for that reason. But you know when somebody has this loud booming voice that's just seems kind of like (pause) I know that what she's saying has no ... like she would tell stories that happened from when we were kids and it was like, "That's just wrong." I mean that's wrong. That's just not factual at all. And so I know that she's crazy. I know that what she's saying is crazy. But ... I don't know it's just, you know, it's just kind of how it's been and it's just been a more recent thing that she's gotten this crazy .... Like she's always been in that role before but the things that she said before held a little bit more truth or like started with a seed of truth and then (pause) kind of went from there. But now it just seems like it's all kind of (pause) just full on crazy.</p>

<p>(00:24:48)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It sounds like you see her as powerful.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Definitely. I think the whole family sees her as powerful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The whole family isn't my patient.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. But what I'm saying is that it's hard to be ... I've always felt like the one on the outside being like (pause) just doing things or saying things a little different and so when I'm like back around everybody it's hard (pause) cause you want to (pause) you know you want to (pause) kind of assimilate to everybody but without ... but then in your own way kind of. Like so every time she's like ... you know like make ... I don't know ... I don't know. Make either like (pause) like a ... says like she didn't mean it like that like try to stickup for my cousins or like say like stickup for my aunt or somebody. And like (inaudible00:26:02) like I don't agree with what she's saying or what she's doing but at the same time like I don't want to be the one fighting with her either. And so you just kind of like let some of it ... I don't know. I guess ... yeah she has this crazy power in my head. She used to watch us a lot as kids. And yeah she was in charge and so when you ... you know I grew up with her just being in charge.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(00:26:32)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like since we were down there I hear myself sounding like her. And whether it's true or not I just hear it. Like words or phrases come out of my mouth and I'm like, "Oh my God that's her." And as soon as I hear it I just like (pause) like watches me to stop speaking.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like what? What do you hear yourself saying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like being argumentative. Everything (chuckle) Nana would say, she would just ... not anything but ... one her things she would just do is just go, "No. No that's not true. That's not true." It's just what she ... that would just be a response of hers. She'll do a lot of things. (laugh) And I do that like I hear myself doing that with my friends in conversation or with Chris you know it's like now. That's definitely not true. It's like that's terrible. That's terrible. Because ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is what people are saying true? I'm not sure what ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like I just ... I hate that immediate reaction of like, "I'm right. I have authority on this and I've heard two sentences of what you've said and I've disqualified it." And whether or not I'm actually doing that, I don't know because (pause) I don't know. (pause) But I do feel like, I like mimic ... I've mimicked some of her authority. Like I've mimicked that kind of behavior and that like ... that's like this toughness is like you know (pause) and I feel like I've mimicked some of it and I don't like that. (Chuckle)</p>

<p>(00:28:27)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Do you feel like if you do that people will take you seriously or listen to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Right. And it comes from just (pause) you know I know that it comes from a lack of self-esteem, a lack of just thinking that people will take me seriously because of what have (pause) to offer or say matters or that they ... you know or because people I'm talking to usually care about me, like me, or love me. And so ... but I just instead take on this like, you know kind of tough attitude and it's not very cute.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cute?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not cute. I'm not charming. It's not like ... like I always kind of play it off in my head. It's like, just kind of like it's like a show. It's just like a cute thing I do. It's like not really cute but like you know kind of like a showy thing. But it's like I'm sure she probably thinks that too. She really doesn't have any awareness of how harsh that comes off and how harsh that sounds. And um (pause) and how it just like makes other ... it just immediately makes the person that she's talking to feel like (pause) okay, like sometimes you're acting, "Okay. Like I'm sorry. What ... all right. Tell me what you have to say because everything you have to say apparently is right and that nothing any of us say is valid." And I just know that I have done that in certain circumstance with my friends or my family and it I just don't want to write people off like that because it's not (pause) I don't know it's just not ... healthy way to have any relationship. (pause)</p>

<p>(00:30:41)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This comes up a lot that you feel like you've sort of assumed some of the behaviors that you dislike most in your family members.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Well I feel like I'm afraid of taking on their strongest (pause) like character flaws. Yeah so my dad's like dependency issues or my dad's mental health issues or you know I guess my grandmother's mental health issues. (pause) Just these (pause) huge things (pause) and I just don't want to be like that. So I feel like I'm always waiting to prove myself ... prove to myself that I like ... I'm just always seeing things that are like them instead of seeing things that aren't like them. I'm always seeing like, "Why'd you do that? Oh my God you do that?" (pause)</p>

<p>(00:32:03)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I guess, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What were you just thinking about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just don't know like ... I was thinking like I'm waiting to prove myself wrong that I'm not like them.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know. (pause) I think if I can be um (pause) you know like not living there is one of the things that made not like them. Moving across country by myself was something that made me not like them and you know living, you know living in different places and meeting different people and meeting people that aren't like me made me think ... you know not like them. And so (pause) now I'm moving back. (laugh) And I was just thinking that, you know like I have this idea for a small business that I'm thinking about for when I move to Massachusetts and it's just something I've been thinking about and writing a lot of ideas about and (pause) And my uncle and I were at dinner asked, "Well what are you going to do when you ...</p>

<p>(Sneeze)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bless you. Moved to Massachusetts and ...</p>

<p>(Sneeze)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bless you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah there's my tissue.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (Chuckle) I said I was ... I had a few glasses of wine at this point because normally I keep these kinds of things kind of close because I don't like ... I always feel like they're going to judge me and then they get really easily in my head about it. I said, "Well I was thinking about taking some business and entrepreneurship classes because I have this idea (pause) and I kind of explained to him. It's like a baby concierge ... I don't know if you've ever heard of them. They're cropping up in mostly New York City and here but (pause) I explained the whole idea to them and they just look at ... like they gave absolutely no reaction at all. Just kind of looked at me after me talking about it for five minutes and just said nothing. Absolutely nothing. And then change the subject to something with Chris. And I was like (pause), "Okay." (Laugh) So you guys think that's a terrible idea? But instead of just saying they don't say anything. And um ... but I feel like if I could do something like that it would make me different me, it would make me (pause) I don't know not only is it something that I'm really excited about and I think, I think is a good idea, but ... (pause) I just feel like it would be something that I could be like proud of and be different from (pause) from them and too that I can just something on my own. I want to do something on my own without their help or without Chris's help or without just on my own.</p>

<p>(00:35:28)</p>

<p>CLIENT: But for them to have the reaction of just staring at me made me feel like, "Oh, okay." Kind of left me (inaudible00:35:39) it. I'm like a little bit ... and keep it at the same time a little bit like, "No I'm definitely going to do it. I'm definitely going to do that." And I'm going to take classes when we move to Massachusetts and I want be really, you know I want to do as best that I can and really try because of that. Well ... (pause)</p>

<p>(Sneeze)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I don't know it made me kind of feel like (inaudible00:36:07). Yeah so I guess that was one of the things that me feel like I could proof to myself that I'm nothing like them. Because none of them ... that's not the driving force behind it, obviously. And that's not ... I wasn't even thinking ... that wasn't even at the forefront of my thinking when I started thinking about, but it was what I was just thinking when you ask me what I was thinking there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well and so far as your therapy you're not like them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (sigh)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that seem true?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it does when I think about it and when I think about just ... just the fact that I'm not ... my grandmother's money is very appealing to me. I think it ... but I'm not afraid at the end of the day either to just say like, "I don't need this. Like I don't need you giving me a hard time. Like I would gladly just not come around anymore and not take any money from you ever again if I have to keep putting up with this." Because it ... I mean I'm going to have to keep putting up with it but like if it gets to a point where it's just like ... like I'm just not going to be around her. This in my mind was like a strike one kind of thing because I just can't ... I mean I know she's not going to change. I know I'm setting myself up to just ... but (pause) like she doesn't do that to my brothers at all, at all. And they don't get it when I say to them; because they both called yesterday to see how it was and they were both really, you know happy about my dad and everything and I talked about my grandmother and neither of them got it.</p>

<p>(00:37:58)</p>

<p>They're totally like, "Yeah I know she does that." (pause) And I was like ... I was like, "Yeah well like what do you do when she does that to you?" And they're like, "Well I just ignore it." And I was like, "Well but what like does she gives you guys a hard time about?" And neither of them could say anything ... like she doesn't give them a hard time. And my brother was like, "You know sometime she like tells me I drink too much." And um ... I said, "But does she tell you like how she does with me where she like sits me up for like ten minutes and goes on like diatribe like ... you know like and kind of bullies me?" He was like, "No she like will make comments." And I was like, "Yeah she makes comments to everybody all day long." But she just doesn't do that to them like she does to me. I don't know I guess I'm hopeful that she'll stop eventually doing it. But I don't know why I'm hopeful. And she's not ever stopped for ... but it's like a thing with women. Like she does it to my aunt Judy. She does it, you know to my aunt Marla her daughter. It's like this thing that she has with women.</p>

<p>(00:39:14)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I was wondering that, I mean the fact that she singles you out and not your brothers.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's ... I mean and my brothers have always been like (pause) (sigh) All hail. And you know I get that my brothers are cute and charming and like sweet and lovely boys but uh ... (pause) but we're all flawed (laugh) individuals like I'm not any (pause) I wasn't not a cute, charming, sweet kid. Like I was a kid and there was nothing about me that deserved any sort of that. I didn't deserve a target on my back that said, "Pick on me because you don't like my personality." You know or ...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No you did not deserve it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so I just, you know it frustrates the life out of me that I'm still, you know with her and my dad and my dad I'm kind of getting what I was looking for and what I was hoping for all this time with him. (pause) And was looking for just a peaceful, calm ... I was looking for him to be interested in me. And for him to you know show any interest. And I got it even if it was just for a weekend. That will do. Like I'll take it. But I'm still waiting with her.</p>

<p>(00:40:46)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's like being fed after being starved for so long.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah exactly. (pause) But you know if there's more that's great. If that's it that's fine. (sniffle) (pause) With her it's a question mark. And I ... you know she's only in Massachusetts for a few months a year. (chuckle) It's good and it's not like I have to live with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know I just ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's five of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you ...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. Yeah I do have to drive.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I'll see you on Friday at 7:45.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'll see you Friday at 7:45, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh is that not a good trashcan?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh no, that's fine.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm just getting your statement for ... what is it for March?</p>

<p>CLIENT: March. Or February.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah February, you're right. Yeah here you go.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, great. I'll see you Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Absolutely. Bye.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bye.</p>

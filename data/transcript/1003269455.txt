<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So since he's always played lots of sports and really athletic, blah-blah-blah, and he hasn't been doing that for the past few months, the doctor just said it's probably like his muscles reacting to that, whatever, the (inaudible at 0:00:14.9).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK. And he's going probably too hard, at first, without...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. So now, he was just told like take it easy for a little while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So what happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I realized - I finally accepted that I have a problem with perfection and expecting too much from people and myself and I'll tell you why. I've also realized - because you asked me last week and I thought about it - I don't why. I think I have so many things to say that I can't think of words when we're talking but - OK, this is really ridiculous. The word that means "not perfect"; like in the middle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mediocre?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, we said "competent" last week. [0:01:03.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Competent, competent. I mean I don't know why I can't think of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. It's alright.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If I was OK with competence and I said, "I thought I was." But then I thought about it this week and I think my competence is really perfection. You know what I mean? I don't think I even know - well, it's not that I don't know what competent is but my vision of competence is being perfect.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you actually raised something very important because I was thinking about this, as well, during the week. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, well, that's great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what do you think about the idea of competence? Do you think that your definition of competence...</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) For example...</p>

<p>THERAPIST:...is the same as, what, like a dictionary would define competence as? For yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know because - this is why I thought about it. Because I was thinking about the whole Portuguese thing and I know I'm competent in Portuguese. Perfect by no means but competent? Sure. I understand, I can speak, whatever. And it's not OK for me. You know what I mean? [0:02:03.0]</p>

<p>So, it's clear that competence is not good enough. And then even with the softball thing. I don't know if I would really be the worst softball player in the world, at this point. I mean maybe I would be like "eh" and that's kind of like competence; if you can play, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. You can get through the game.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You can get through. And that's not OK for me. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that's what made me think about it. Fern√£o has also uncovered this issue. He told me a number of times this week that he thinks that I have a problem. It's like I think that I need to be perfect all the time or whatever. So he's beginning to realize this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you mentioned this to him before or he just came up with this on his own?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) No. He came up with it. He came up with it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sure that was great. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, "Great, great." Yeah.</p>

<p>And then, there are a number of things that - well, this week was really difficult. I don't know why but I was really irritable. Even though I realize that all of this - and you would think like since I realized it, maybe I'd be able to attack a little bit better; it seemed to have the reverse effect. [0:03:08.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. So you think you were irritable because you were thinking about the fact that you couldn't accept not being perfect or were there other things going on?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Maybe that's why. Maybe that's why but I don't know. I mean I had an argument. I was really, really, really tired on Saturday and when I'm tired, I'm my worst self; like worst, worst, worst. And I went to eat with Julia. We were talking and lately it's - I don't know this annoys me but - I'm sure I know I did this when I went to Lisbon for the first time - but all he talks about is how great Portugal is and things that he doesn't like about America. Which is - I don't like a lot of things about America and I didn't want to live in this city.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. But they better not talk about it here.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is your boyfriend like that? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly, exactly. And it's like I didn't want to live in this city until I got deported and I had no choice, you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it annoys me. So, we were just talking, having a conversation. I was trying to explain something to him and he kept interrupting me, interrupting me, interrupting me. And first he said, "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. Go." And then I tried to talk again and he interrupted me and I just lost it. I didn't start - I've noticed that I don't get angry and I don't lose my temper but I get angry and it's obvious. And I won't speak and I get annoyed and I can't get rid of the annoyance. [0:04:26.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so that's one thing. And then I was just like, "Well, yeah, he interrupted me but he's not a piece of shit; he's not doing it on purpose." He later explained sometimes, which I think this was like - you know when you know you did something wrong and you try to make up excuses that are really getting insane? I think this was kind of like that but he was saying how speaking in English is so difficult for him, even though he speaks really well. And sometimes he doesn't know the rhythm and blah-blah-blah and interrupting isn't as bad in Portuguese as it is in English. So I was like, "OK, whatever. But fuck." [0:04:59.0]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you think maybe he was at fault in this conversation but you were just not dealing with it well?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think he was at fault. I mean interrupting is shitty and he acknowledged that the first time he did it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then my reaction was very extreme.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like a little too much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. It's like, "Just relax. He interrupted you. He doesn't speak the language." You know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) He was a little irritable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, well, there was that and then - what else happened? There were like a few things. I had another argument about something. Oh, yesterday, we had an argument because my mom's cousin passed away and my mom asked me if I'd go to the wake. And he couldn't go because he had classes and he asked me if that was OK and I - of course, my mom would never expect him if he has classes. He doesn't know anyone in my family, whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then he asked me later, in the day, the same thing. And I just felt like I told him the answer already like, "My mom doesn't care, blah-blah-blah." And he kind of got bent out of shape about it, whatever. And he got annoyed with me because he felt like I wasn't being understanding of his wanting to know more information. [0:06:14.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is, he's not always right in these situations, either. But there is a really big part of me that is very intolerant of not being perfect, even though...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the perfection - isn't that what we're talking about - in yourself and then this fight would be the perfection in other people - he should have known.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) But this week, I noticed it more in the way I've been doing it to other people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But do you think noticing is a good first step or is it more irritating you because actually - because you get to actually see yourself? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I hope so. I hope so, OK? It's the reason why we have a really big problem. (chuckles) No, I think - yeah, I think it is finally acknowledging it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if this goes along with it. Do you think you have (chuckles) - it relates to the perfectionism. Do you think you have a problem accepting the fact that you have a problem? [0:07:03.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, I do. (Therapist laughs) Yes, actually, I do. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) So it's hard to accept yourself as someone who has problems because then you're not perfect again?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I think maybe that's why I've been really irritable this week, partly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Because you've had to kind of realize and take a good look at the fact that you're not going to be perfect.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) The other thing is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you're noticing it around you and people are noticing it, as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. And there are other things that, this week, I've realized. I think like maybe I've finally accepted some things that I haven't wanted to accept this week. I mean nothing really that major, unfortunately, but just the job situation, the dependence on other people. I'm not happy about it and I wouldn't go as far to say as I'm depressed but, for me, it's really difficult because I've been pretty independent since I graduated college. [0:07:53.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm really lucky that I have people who are willing to support me and allow me to have the life that I basically want.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) It's not your ideal and it's not the way you (inaudible at 0:08:03.4) it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. And the Finn thing and all that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) But you're in the process of doing this all, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I mean can you look at it a little bit glass half-full with the fact that Fern√£o (sp) is here and you could be doing a long-distance relationship?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the thing. Well, today, right before I came here actually, I sort of had a breakdown and I told Fern√£o (sp) about how I've been feeling.</p>

<p>You know, normally I'm OK. I know I'm going to get this job sooner or later; I know the Finn thing will either work out or it's not the end of the world, whatever. But sometimes it's just like - maybe it's my negativity just adding all these negative things on top of each other.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then it becomes a lot to handle.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think a lot of people have trouble with this, when you're in limbo; you know, a place where you don't know the decision, you're waiting around and you still have nothing confirmed and you feel like you're doing nothing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think a lot of people have difficulty with that. [0:08:57.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I could see that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think this comes down to cutting yourself some slack for responding kind of like most other people.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I know, I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had also asked you to make - for homework, to make a list of the mistakes you've made this week. Did you remember to do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn't write them down but the fight that I had with Fern√£o (sp) that I told you about, the first one, was the first time that I realized I made a mistake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So that's one of the mistakes; kind of cutting people short or making too much of a big deal about something that's little and making a fight, intensifying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So not cutting people slack; that's kind of a mistake.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that happened twice, I guess, with Fern√£o (sp).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It happened probably more than twice but I think I covered it up really well the other times, so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh. Are there any other things?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean I guess the problem that I have is defining what a mistake is, you know? [0:09:56.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. I guess another mistake or a time you've disappointed somebody, a mistake that you've made or it could be something that you didn't do competently. I think that may be the thing that we really need to work on and maybe I didn't specify that enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Didn't do competently?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because I think that comes - or not to a level that you'd like to see it done, which is a very high level.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. Well, I don't know if this is stupid but I've been really down on myself lately because since I came here - it's been a while, actually, because I got here in August and I wasn't allowed back in Portugal. So, since I've gotten here, I've gained some weight and I've been really, really, really hard on myself for that. I mean it's not like it's 30 pounds or anything but when it's noticeable to yourself, at least.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you've kind of disappointed yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then since I've realized this, which is - I would say I've finally acknowledged it, fully, two weeks ago - I've been saying I'm going to eat properly, I'm going to exercise, blah-blah-blah and I haven't. I haven't. Well, I did eat really well yesterday but, other than that, I haven't done a good job. And I have not exercised. [0:11:09.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's see what you just did is you said, "Other than that." Do you think you do that a lot?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like downplay the good that you've done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Oh, God, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then play up how bad everything else is.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. I'm always self-deprecating. Always, always, always.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And that maybe relates to the idea that you have such a high ideal for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That nothing is really good enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I guess, what would you like to work on? (Client chuckles) The getting angry at people?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, God. Everything. Oh, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Well, there's kind of two major things. We can still work on the acceptance of being, you know, less than perfect or doing things less than perfectly or less than the way you'd like to see them done. But I think that relates to these other things, so we could work with a specific problem. We could work about accepting yourself for getting angry quickly but that would be more like things you want to work on. [0:12:05.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So maybe let's talk about the weight?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. Also, I was just thinking about this. I think this week I really should write down a list of the things that I don't think I do as well as I would like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I was just thinking about how I did the laundry today and how I was kind of annoyed with myself because I didn't finish it like in the amount of time that I wanted and I didn't fold it properly. And that's kind of just ridiculous.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why don't we just say that now? You want to talk about that one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because that one is fresh in your mind.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what happened with the laundry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I decided to do it because I was bored and it needed to be done. And I mean I did it but the laundry machines are really weak and so it didn't dry in an hour or whatever it was. [0:12:55.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so, I had to keep it going for a little while longer. So then it made the time - you know how laundry is; like then it took longer than I thought. And then I didn't put the clothes away as quickly as I had wanted to. It's really like - I don't know. It's the way I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So did you have plans to do something else if you weren't doing laundry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. Well, I feel like this is really OCD but my plan was - I was like, "OK. Well..." We were going to - Fern√£o (sp) still hasn't gone food shopping and I'm sick of going out to dinner. As much as I love it, it gets to be - so I told him we should go food shopping when he got home from school.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, my plan was that I was going to put the laundry in, get my nails done, shower and then have everything - I didn't get my nails. Oh, I got my toes done but nothing else - and have everything finished by 5:00 when Fern√£o (sp) should have been arriving home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that you'd go food shopping together?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so that we'd have time to go food shopping and whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And in this plan, you only had time to get your toenails done; not your nails. [0:14:03.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I don't actually usually like to get my nails done because they chip so quickly that - I don't like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) So what didn't you get done that you wanted to do? Because it sounds like you did everything but just not in the timeframe that you had planned.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It wasn't in the timeframe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what time - were you not done by 5:00 when he got home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what time did you go food shopping or did you not go?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you didn't go food shopping.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So instead you got your nails done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, which is good and whatever but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, but you would have rather - would you have rather gone food shopping than get your nails done or you rather get your nails done than go food shopping? Which it sounds like you did. That's what you wanted to do so you did it. [0:14:35.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but I couldn't - the thing was we were going to go together food shopping, so he had to have been home. You know what I mean? I got my nails done before he got home.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you did?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then when he got home, why couldn't you go food shopping at 5:00?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because the laundry was still in the thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, you got your nails done while the laundry was...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So the laundry was still going, so you couldn't go food shopping at the time and then you had therapy, so you had to fall back down. [0:14:58.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. Right, right. So, it wouldn't have been enough time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So did he go food shopping?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could he?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, he didn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you wanted to do it together.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He needs help; a lot of help. He doesn't know what he's doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you mean? He doesn't know how to buy food? They don't have food in Portugal?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) No, because he's lived with his parents until now.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they also have a housekeeper that lives there that does everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Oh, yeah, yeah. But what if he went food shopping? What would happen?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He wouldn't get all the things that I like and he wouldn't know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you said - now you don't have anything that you like, because there's nothing in the house.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I know. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if he went food shopping, he'd at least be doing it for himself and...</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean for someone I know who has grown up and has everything done for them, do you think you're really helping him by doing it for him than when he goes?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) No, no, no. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if he came back and you didn't have everything - he didn't do a perfect job food shopping or a job that was up to your standard of food shopping. [0:16:06.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe he only got enough food for the weekend but he didn't - I'm a person - I shop for the week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't like going food shopping two times a week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So is that how you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I like to just do it all in one shot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Have a great shop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Suppose he only gets enough - because I think in Europe they kind of get more for like the day. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "What do you mean? I went food shopping; I got enough for tonight."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what if he comes back and he only has enough for dinner that night; he didn't get anything else for the week for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then we'd have to go again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would that be OK? You would have to go again, anyway; he never went the first time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it would be OK but it's just annoying; like you could have gotten this all done one time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) So you get home. Imagine, right now, he decided, all on his own, he's going to be really proactive. "Well, Laura is in therapy. I'm going to go food shopping" and he does a terrible job: he gets cereal without milk, he gets eggs without bacon. I don't know, whatever goes together and you have one item but not the other.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He gets fruit that's all under-ripe.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you come home. What emotion do you think you would feel?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe just annoyed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Annoyed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't think I'd be angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just annoyed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I wouldn't be angry or - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think you would like to feel something different.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead of annoyed, would you like...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I would like to just not be annoyed because it's not something I think you should be annoyed about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you might not be happy. Can you be, I don't know - what's between happy and annoyed? Is "frustrated" the same as "annoyed" to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It is?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Instead of frustrated, you could get annoyed but you can be frustrated without being annoyed, right? [0:18:03.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, you could.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You could be frustrated or you could just have a level of acceptance that this is the way Fern√£o (sp) shops, so it kind of would be like acceptance; not happy, not annoyed but just "it is what it is."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If Fern√£o (sp) goes shopping, this is generally what's going to happen.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. You'd like to have a level of acceptance.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) More of accepting. Yeah, and more, maybe, patient.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think there's a little bit of impatience that goes along with this, you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So, Fern√£o (sp) comes home; you're feeling annoyed. Maybe we'd say really annoyed. What if he forgot like something important that you needed? Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know you're trying to eat healthy so you want salads and stuff.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And he probably knows that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He knows that you're trying to eat healthy?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK, what if he came home and he bought like a big chocolate cake for dessert? Would you be annoyed? [0:19:02.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd be annoyed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you be a little more than annoyed?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I'd be really annoyed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckling) But what if he wanted chocolate cake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean it's OK but the fact that if it's only chocolate cake...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, he bought like pasta for dinner. (Therapist and Client chuckle) Pasta for dinner and chocolate cake for dessert. Maybe you'd be feeling a little more than annoyed.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A little angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a little angry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So what are you thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he's a selfish piece of shit. (laughs) It's so bad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he's a selfish piece of shit?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you saying he should have...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He should have realized that I wanted healthy food and he should have took that into consideration and bought something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Alright. "He should shop the way that I want him to shop"? [0:20:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. (chuckles) It's so bad. Well, if he's shopping for two people, then yeah, he should.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. What if he got the big chocolate cake and he also got you some lettuce? (Therapist and Client chuckle) Would you still be angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So it would just be if he didn't get anything for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So "Fern√£o (sp) should shop and be considerate for me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you say he should, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What an asshole. If he doesn't, he's a dick.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If he doesn't, do you say, "I can't stand it," or more it's like, "He's such a dick"? "I can't stand it when he doesn't think about me"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. The "I can't stand it" - this is another revelation I've had this week, just so you know. The "I can't stand it" comes after, once I've acknowledged that we had a disagreement and that I was wrong because I wasn't tolerant or whatever. And then, I can't stand the fact that I did what I did. [0:21:10.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) That you made a mistake. So not in the moment.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. The "I can't stand it" is later. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, we're more talking about - we're talking about the moment when you get angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So you're angry and you're saying, "He should have shopped with me in mind," right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "He should be considerate of my needs and he should do things the way that I want them done."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. When you say those things, do you think it makes you more likely to be accepting or more likely to be angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (Therapist chuckles) No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It makes you more likely to be angry when you say those things that way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the strongest one? Or do you ever say, "If he didn't, he should think about me when he goes food shopping and if he doesn't, he doesn't care about me"? Or is it more, "He should think about me when he goes food shopping and he's a dick if he doesn't"? [0:22:03.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's that. (Therapist chuckles) I think it's more that. Like I anticipate the mistakes that he's going - not him; we're just using him as an example. Anyone. I anticipate the mistakes. So, if I think, "Well, OK, who's doing shopping? Well, he's not going to come home with the lettuce and what if he doesn't come home with the lettuce and blah-blah-blah?" And then when he doesn't come home with the lettuce, it's built up so much, because I've anticipated it, that I get angry quicker.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah. But how do you think you start that anticipation? Is it by thinking, "Fern√£o (sp) is going shopping. If he gets what he gets, it's fine; I can always pick something up"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or you're thinking, "Fern√£o (sp) has to get..."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like he has to do it the way I want it or if he doesn't think about me, he's a dick.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So I think you've brought some good points; like some good setting events that you prepare. You start the rumination before you even get home.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think you're usually more angry when you do that or what if you just open the fridge? Like you get home and you open the fridge and you didn't even think about it but all you see is a big chocolate cake in the fridge. Which one would be - or they'd both make you angry, probably? [0:23:06.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I think the thinking about it before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I might be like, "What did you do?" But I don't think I'd be angry; I think I'd be more likely to laugh about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You'd be like, "I get it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. So, what can you do about this? Any ideas? What do we do in EBT? You have these thoughts; you're saying a lot of demands, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A lot of shoulds. And you think of this all the time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I need a new thought.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A new belief?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Belief.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A rational one?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Many, many of them, yeah. One would be good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) What would be more rational than to think, "Fern√£o (sp) should buy the things I want and if he doesn't, he's a dick"? (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like anything. Like anything other than that. [0:24:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something could be more rational?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean come on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, let's dispute this before we give you a new one. Does that mean that Fern√£o (sp) is a dick because he didn't buy the food you want?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) No. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why doesn't it mean that? He sounds like a dick; he didn't buy you lettuce. He's not thinking about you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You're bringing] (ph) the dick, you should break up with him. Can't buy you lettuce.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I mean he doesn't really know what he's doing and he wasn't - I don't know. I mean maybe to him - well, you said he brought chocolate cake and pasta, right?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe to him, pasta is not that bad; it's not that unhealthy. Or he bought the chocolate cake but he wants to go out to dinner somewhere healthy instead. I mean there are possibilities.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK. So he didn't do it on purpose?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He's not intentionally trying to make me fat, I mean you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK. And what about the bigger one, that "Fern√£o (sp) should do things the way that I want them done and if he doesn't, he's an asshole"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: People have to do things the way that you want or they're an asshole? [0:25:10.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) No, they don't. They don't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why are they an asshole if they don't do that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thing is that I know that it's true but I feel like it's what you said; like I don't really believe it or something. I know. I know that's not true but - you know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So you know it's not true. Why would he be an asshole if he didn't do the things that you wanted? Why should people do the things that you want and the way you want them done?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckling) I don't know. I don't really know a good answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) It's the right way?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Maybe.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there really only one right way to do something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But yours is the best way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Has anyone ever come up with a better way than you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: They have? (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I know. (chuckles) Aren't you so shocked? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what happens when they do? Do you feel bad about yourself? "Oh, my God. They had a better idea than me."</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So other people can have good ideas, too. [0:26:00.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what happens if other people make mistakes? What does that mean to you? Why do you get so mad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. It's really weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you have high demands for everything, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On yourself; on everyone around you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And you know what I think? I don't know sometimes when I should have a high demand or when it's too high or what's the right - you know what I mean?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I have trouble differentiating because I think my demands are always so high.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So it's difficult.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there any things in life, I mean that you don't need to have such high demands on? You know, maybe that's something you could do for homework: the things in life that you need to keep that high demand on, that you really want to keep that high level of doing things well and the other things that you don't have to do as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That you could be happy, even if you were just mediocre or even poor at a few things. [0:27:11.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about - are you a good cook?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you accept yourself being not...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I do.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that's something that you don't have a high level of demand on yourself for; to be a good cook.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're OK with that. So what do you think when you've made a meal and it comes out bad? Why are you not angry? What are you thinking?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I'm just not good at cooking and it's fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That even if you're not good at cooking, there are other things that you're good at.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. But I think the thing is...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can accept yourself even if you're not perfect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. I think the thing is, though, sometimes, because I do have things that I know I'm not good at - like cooking or cleaning, for example; I'm not the best cleaner or whatever - that it becomes even more important for me to have perfection in other things. You know what I mean? [0:28:09.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. So if you can't be perfect in everything, you should at least have a few things you - but I think...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like what good am I if I can't be good at something?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what good are you if you're not...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) So let's talk about that. What if you're not good at something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: At anything?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. (Client chuckles) What if you're just mediocre at everything? I mean we're getting a little off track because we were talking more about the anger.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) The truth is I probably am just mediocre or competent at most things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: At everything?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean if you look at the worst performer in something and the best, I'm probably, like most people, in the middle. You know?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How does it feel to say that out loud?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Shitty. I don't like it, actually. I thought about it before, too, how I don't really have anything that I'm really amazingly good at. [0:29:00.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But even if you were amazingly good at something, there are always mistakes that you'd make at it, right? Even the best batter strikes out a lot, really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Someone told me Babe Ruth's stats once and they were like - I don't know a lot of baseball but...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was a good example; I can't remember. (laughs)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know what you mean, though.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you know, he struck out tons of times; way more times than he got home runs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But we remember him being the best batter of all time, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And even the best concert violinist is going to make a few mistakes, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Every once in a while. So no one can be perfect, even your boyfriend.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you want him to be perfect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Could you stand it if he - can you accept him if he's not perfect?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, for sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What if he continues to do things that go against, you know, the way you want them done? What if he did that for the rest of your life? [0:30:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, he probably will but I think the problem is the way I...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So if he probably will, you're just going to spend your life being angry?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I really need to change it. That's not working for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. And how can you change that? What can you think instead of "Fern√£o (sp) must do things the way that I want them done or he's a dick" or "I can't - he's a terrible boyfriend"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he doesn't, I mean...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What about starting out with a preference, remember?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I would like - I prefer if Fern√£o (sp) or anyone, everyone, did things the way that I like them done but since it's not realistic and most likely won't happen...[0:31:02.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) "I can accept that"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can accept it. I can tolerate it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you don't have to let it ruin your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I really hope it doesn't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And their life, as well; you'll make someone miserable. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. I'm really nervous about that, honestly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's what actually you're worrying about too much, that you're making yourself so miserable. You know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah. I know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you think about it all day long and then, after you get mad, then comes the self-loathing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) After, it's the worst part of everything, is like I literally can't stand it. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm so upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, we have the first thing and it's usually, I guess, when other people make a mistake and you get angry about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But then the fact that you made a mistake - so, you just said something about when people - can't you say the same about yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I did try to use our belief from last time, that I would like to be perfect but if I can't, I can accept myself. [0:32:05.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Which was?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I mean it's just really difficult because it's such a bad habit.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Would you really want to be perfect at everything, though, if you could?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, you can say if you could.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think so. Not in everything. But I think - the thing is, my perfect is - I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) You might be boring?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it's like a skewed...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I think here's the thing. When you were talking about competence, I think you were dead-on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Competence is probably like, what, 50 - or probably less; probably like 30 percent of the population can do or something, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you probably hold yourself to a standard of 90 percent, right? That would be competence; to be able to get an A on everything. Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ninety. But if you started really getting an A on everything, do you think your level of competence would stay there or you think you would raise it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'd raise it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, when are you going to be happy? [0:33:00.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (chuckles) I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Even if you were "competent" at everything you did, it wouldn't be enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. It wouldn't be enough.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When can you just accept yourself as you are or accept the world as it is and people around you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it's good to think about this but it doesn't mean you're terrible because you hold these thoughts. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I know that but...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you sure? Because you said you were beating yourself up about it all week.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, I beat myself up for a really good amount of time after and then eventually I get over it but it lasts a really long time. I'm not still beating myself up over that thing that happened but I mean I did for like a good few hours. [0:33:55.7]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) OK. You're beating yourself up over getting mad or getting angry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, you apologized to him, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And can you say, "I'm human. I make mistakes"?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you think beating yourself up about it helps?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it help you fix your relationship with Fern√£o (sp)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And he also acknowledged that. He said that to me, "People fight. You made a mistake. Why are you beating yourself up over this? It's not the end of the world."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And by beating yourself up about not being perfect, you're probably doing an even worse job of being a girlfriend and being there for people and being there for yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So let me hear you say your statement to yourself again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: The one from last week?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I don't want to say anymore that I want to be perfect, even though maybe I'd like to do my best all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Even though I'd like to do my best all the time, if I can't, I can accept it if I make a mistake. [0:35:06.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And maybe you could even see it as something good if - everybody is a work-in-progress. If you weren't, how boring life would be.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know, you're something that you're working to improve yourself on. Not everybody does that, do they?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some people probably say, "This is how I am. Fuck you if you don't like it."</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're working on yourself.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Makes life interesting.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm just worried that I'm not going to be able to change it, ever, and I'm always going to be this like nagging, horrible...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And what if you were?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That'd suck.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But thinking that "I have to get better, I have to get better, I have to get better," are you going to more likely get better?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I know. I just find like no end to the fucked up way I think about things and it's so...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You might never change. Could you have a fulfilling life even if you didn't? [0:36:01.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like the way that I think about things - the negative obsessing and whatever - these thoughts...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But the more you tell yourself how horrible you are for having those thoughts, the less likely you are to change them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The more likely they're going to keep happening. So if you really want to change, you've got to stop putting demands on yourself, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's hard.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's really hard. It's really, really hard.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I think we're out of time. So you're going to make a list for me of the things...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Let me see if I have my notebook so I can write this down and I don't - yeah. (searches through items) Yeah, the mistake - no, what did you say?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was like the list of things that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not competent. [0:37:00.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the things that you are OK with not being competent at or a reason that we're competent, loosely, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The things that you're OK with not being successful, maybe, because that's a better word, right? Successful at?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right? And the things that you feel like you couldn't stand it; you couldn't live without being successful at the other things.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Like 100 percent successful. The list of things I'm not successful at and...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The things you feel like you need it to be successful at, which is a pretty unrational thing to say, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Things I must - yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then we'll have some things to dispute next week, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Practice those things. Are you still reading the book?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, slowly but surely.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and I think that I need - if it's possible; I'm not sure if it's even possible - but some belief or something that can help me stop thinking about things so negatively and also so demanding; you know, with such demand. [0:38:12.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that's what we have, so...(Therapist and Client laugh)</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know but when is it just like a miracle?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) When is it going to kick in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You've got to keep saying it, you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Got to keep saying them until you believe it, alright?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other thoughts may never go away. That's the truth. But you'll have a faster replacement and hopefully you'll get over these things faster, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Then maybe it won't take three days or hours before you can say, "OK, I made a mistake. Let's move on." Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or "He made a mistake. Let's move on." Right? You still might have the thought, "Oh, I can't believe he didn't do it." But then you have the (snaps fingers) replacement thought to come right in and say, "Oh but it's not the end of the world. It's OK if he doesn't do things the way I want." [0:39:03.9]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Alright. I have to repeat these things. But do you think that I should repeat them constantly or just when...?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no. I think constantly.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if I'm just thinking, I guess I should just be thinking of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) Yeah, if you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) I think that's better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I tend to forget if I don't do it often.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) I think you should think it as much as you can.</p>

<p>CLIENT: OK.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So that when something does happen, (snaps fingers) you have it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (overlapping voices) You're not likely to use something that you don't use very often, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (overlapping voices) Right. Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the other thoughts come so naturally to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's the thing. It's a problem.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Alright. (chuckles)</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like you would answer it anyways.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, no, it's just I think it stops the recording.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You use a special program or you just use the voice recorder?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I use - there's like a special dictation program that's actually mostly for doctors and lawyers so there's a bunch of security features, like automatic upload features and stuff like that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My first - I guess my second legal job, my first accounting job was where I met Jess and we had our little carrels next to each other - corals or whatever those things are.</p>

<p>But one of the partners was trying to get me to dictate to have the secretary type everything up and it just, you know, so used to typing everything myself. This was 1998, '99 and they were upgrading to Windows 95 from the 3. [00:01:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I remember those days.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And lawyers were notoriously behind the times in technology.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, really?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I had a CPA I worked for who, you know, I'd draft and then he would just literally cut and paste with scissors and tape and have the...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (Laughing) The old school type paste?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And have the secretary retype it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah. I made my own coffee this morning.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I figured I probably shouldn't be spending money at Starbucks and what not. [00:02:07]</p>

<p>You know I was so upset on Friday, if I just listened to my voice-mail, I had a new client on my voice-mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's not like it's going to save me or anything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it's another collection which I won't screw up this one. I think I pretty much screwed up the other one, but this one I'll do properly.</p>

<p>And it's good that I'm in the middle of my own condo trying to collect for me, so I've got some good, you know.</p>

<p>My reasons on the first one were just I didn't think it was a typical collection. They were going after penalties and things that I didn't think were, you know, clearly proper.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:03:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I felt that trying to secure a super lien where you notify the lender and you give all these and you bring the lender into the lawsuit and file the complaint and registry and all these different things you would normally do, it really wasn't that type of case.</p>

<p>And of course they counterclaimed for harassment and then, you know, so I - part of me says I did the right thing and I still every once in a while would wake up in the middle of the night and think I did the wrong thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I still have the opportunity to create a super lien if she doesn't pay up on the judgment if I get a judgment.</p>

<p>One of the two trustees is leaving the country for five years and his defendant, like any day now, and the defendant said that she was going to have the Court stop him from leaving the country. [00:04:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Whoa.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That's the kind of loony bin we're dealing with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I still get to meet her attorney, you know, he argued in court. And she didn't show up for it. I don't know, I guess I'll meet here April 12 when we do our summary judgment motion.</p>

<p>But I still - Jess asked me to, you know, we're hiring an attorney to do...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The legal stuff?</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...the legal stuff, which is basically me still filling out everything and then him just dealing, you know, sort of being the go-between. So it's like I'm doing all the work anyways.</p>

<p>But for the retainer he wants me to ask my step-mom for the money. She doesn't know that I'm going to be asking for all this other money. [00:05:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I can't decide whether I should call my dad; wait until he comes up here and kind of put it in an e-mail. And I think today I'm going to send an e-mail saying I can't - couldn't decide whether I should put this in an e-mail or call you or wait until you come up so I'm just going to rightfully tell you what I need and a brief description why and we can talk about it more, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What's the retainer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: We've giving him 500. And the agreement says 1,000, but we're giving him 500. And I think we're going to get him another 1,000 or whatever, but we're taking it out of the kit money, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So what money the case is making, we took the 500 out of. But I've got two months of rent I'm behind. I've got to fix my car. Just, I mean I get so angry in the morning, you know, just listening to that thing, you know, squeak and squirm. [00:06:09]</p>

<p>It's like, you know, I need transmission fluid I mean I'm screwing my car up badly by just...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got to get the thing fixed and it's a ton of money. I got to pay my auto insurance. I haven't paid my student loan for the last month. I got to pay my rent, you know.</p>

<p>I was going to take the retainer and take part of that to pay for the rent; pre-pay myself which is (inaudible at 00:06:49), so I probably should ask for the money. I don't know. I can't seem to - I mean January was an awful month, you know. [00:07:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I definitely made very little money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I'm assuming that some of these closings are going to close in March. There is one that will at least close at the end of March because it's a FHA streamline which takes literally like two weeks to process.</p>

<p>But you close them at the end of the month because no matter when you pay it off, FHA loans they charge you for the whole month and interest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So you try and close it far to the end of the month to eliminate as much double pay of interest as you can.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So we got - we haven't heard back from the people who were putting the offer on the condo. [00:08:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: On your condo?</p>

<p>CLIENT: and a lot of people are concerned number 1, with the condition of the basement. It's like a spot where termites, you know, ate part of the wall.</p>

<p>And my condo fee is like $550 which everyone is barking at. People are coming through which we had like seven showings on Sunday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, wow that's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But now that these other people know that we haven't gotten any offers because, you know, Claire would have called and said hey, you got another offer. You know, shit or get off the pot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And partly I'm okay with that because that just is more rent coming in, you know. But as we get in to August, do I bring in a new tenant, you know, knowing I'm going to be foreclosed on?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, so at least until August I'm okay. [00:09:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I had lunch with Claire on Friday and she said, "Well you look good." But she has had some stuff to deal with. Her daughter has some developmental problems...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that, you know, they couldn't understand why she didn't want to like play catch because she would just space out in the middle of playing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She has these little problems.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So she really hasn't - you know, she says she's got this stack of, you know, I've changed my job, you know, letters or cards or whatever and she hasn't even sent those out yet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's good in a way, right in that it means that she hasn't necessarily been avoiding you for (inaudible at 00:10:05).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right, right. And I think she - and she has had two listings which both I saw that she put on the market and took off the market that didn't sell which I kind of knew.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I knew she had a big commission and she's probably living off that for a few months. And you know now I guess she has to get back at it.</p>

<p>But, you know, if she can - if we have a decent spring and summer, you know, and get some extra closings, you know, maybe I can - and a little help from my parents, you know, I can maybe get a little bit ahead or, you know...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That would be great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or find out what's going - it's just there's so many uncertainties with the modification, the taxes, the short sale, it's like all these things are like weighing on me. [00:11:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And Kay's like, have you heard anything on the modification? I'm like, no. She's like well, I just like I wake up at night. I mean I stay awake all night thinking about that; where are we going to live, you know.</p>

<p>You know it's like she's got this pool of money that, you know, she'll be able to find a place to live, you know, if they foreclose.</p>

<p>You know I think the IRS - you know our lawyer advised us to take the money out of the account, and she basically wrote a cashier's check to herself that's going to show on the statement if we have to submit all our statements to the IRS they're going to see that.</p>

<p>So I don't - you know, hopefully we hear about the modification before this IRS thing comes through, you know, and spend that money somehow, some way. [00:12:00]</p>

<p>But basically there is zero concern for, you know, where I'm going to live or what I'm going to do or, you know, there's just, you know, there's no sympathy there. There's nothing, you know.</p>

<p>I've been having a lot of issues with getting light-headed when I stand up, and I've been over there a lot and it's happened a lot while I'm over there. And she did say she was concerned, you know. But I don't know, probably more concerned when I'm holding the baby and fall over.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. When do you next see (inaudible at 00:12:53).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Two weeks.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Have you mentioned this to her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, it hasn't been this bad. Really it was just like an off thing and now it seems to be a little more consistent, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's un-weed related?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's un-weed related?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so; yeah. I think it's because I'm lying down on the couch and then I like stand up. And so just sitting up first and - but I'm not lying down at Jess's when it's happening so, I don't know. We'll see how the next two weeks go.</p>

<p>Lucille has her first parlor trick. If you tell her to go sleepy, she'll lie down. And she was standing right here and I said, "Go sleepy." And she put her head down in my lap. So that's her first parlor trick. [00:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. How cute.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I had to pick her up yesterday and she was just - at first she kind of came over to me with a little bit of her, you know, half cry, ay, ay. And then once I got her in the car seat she just started laughing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she was having fun and then she was in the room and I was in the kitchen and she was in the other room all by herself and got upset and I literally had to hold her, you know, more than 45 minutes.</p>

<p>I got to put her down or, you know, she just wanted to be held.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I think she was sleepy. She kept rubbing her eyes, you know. But she perked up when my mom got home.</p>

<p>So - which drives me nuts because on Saturday, you know, Ian is jumping all over me. She's worried that he's got strep and he's just like all over me, you know. [00:15:12]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: he has all this energy and he just - but she like calls urgent care and we go and we take him in to urgent care and, you know, they do a culture and, you know, I'm at the doctor's office and he jumps on my - I'm like bent over showing Lucille the fish tank and he jumps on my back, you know.</p>

<p>And it's like I turn to Jess and I go does this look a kid who has strep, you know. And she's like, I just want to be sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: because he had a cold and, you know, he's been fine and just that kind of stuff drives me nuts.</p>

<p>You know she really; I don't know. It's kind of ironic because she finds the dog now to be this disgusting being. And granted he does pee on his paws and lick his paws which I think is part of it so it's kind of dog specific, but on the refrigerator is a picture of our old dog, you know, licking her, you know. [00:16:19]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she's, you know, licking her right on the mouth, you know. And so it's not me. She really has changed when the kids - this is pre-Ian; the picture.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And she really has just gone completely nuts with the food on the floor and the dog licking and just the kids sick, you know, is it strep, you know, just over protective.</p>

<p>And we used to laugh at people like that, you know. Oh, that will never be us and she became that person.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that kind of drives me batty a little bit. [00:17:03]</p>

<p>So, but I got to write that e-mail to my dad today. He's coming into town on Thursday. I mean he's going to hear how bad my car is and see the check engine lights on and, you know.</p>

<p>I don't know, I don't know what I'd do next winter when the same thing happens, you know, or if at some point this summer I could have a bad month or, you know. I mean this is kind of like my last opportunity, you know.</p>

<p>Of course my grandmother dies to really, you know, have someone bail me out, and I don't know. [00:18:08]</p>

<p>I've decided to go into the - I was going to go up today because I had this 1099 problem I thought, that someone didn't get a 1099 and was e-mailing me. And I told them that I'd - it was a mom and, you know, the daughter and son-in-law, and I sent them together to the son-in-law. And it was like oh, I actually sent it to you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then last night he sent an e-mail back that he had it. So I'm going to go up tomorrow morning for the Chamber meeting. You know there are a couple of accountants and realtors that I'm going to be seeing so I'm going to start visiting Rotaries.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think that's the stuff I have to do to just kind of get my name out there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds good for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know, I'm probably not going to see a result for two to three years, you know? [00:19:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Coughing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I've got to do it. You know I'm back to ground zero, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cameron, you've been through a hell of a lot in the last year, year and a half, I mean.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm glad somebody noticed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In all sorts of different ways. I mean the stuff between you and Jess, all the financial stuff, the stress, all the depression; being in and out of the hospital. You know, losing your main referral sources for work; like all at the same time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Are you supposed to help make me feel better?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a hell of a lot to recover from. And like look, I know there's still a ways to go, but in terms of like feeling some degree of motivation, being able to concentrate, you know, on what you need to do; being able to like ask for the help you need, you know.</p>

<p>I mean that stuff is all (inaudible at 00:20:16) better than it was even a few months ago, let alone a few months before that, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know I never would have...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You're in much better shape than you were, you know, six months or a year ago; much better.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never would have noticed this unless Jess told me, but we have these mugs that are half plastic that you can taste the plastic so she hates them. And when she said that to me I started noticing the plastic taste and I can't, you know.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed, you know, getting coffee from the shop. I'm still going to - you know I'm not going to always have the coffee made, you know, but I've got to cut back some, you know. [00:21:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know. Jess had a very good month and she's helping me out with taking (inaudible at 00:21:25), extra money for the health insurance, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And there's a friend - a friend, a guy, that (inaudible at 00:21:55) you know, put out on Facebook, does anybody know a good realtor, and I referred him to Claire.</p>

<p>And she basically told him that they're not going to be able to sell their house, but he was really impressed with her and very happy with that. She might have mentioned something to him about, you know, talk to Cameron about a refinance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I referred him to my guy. You know, I don't know if they've connected. Or if they connect then that might be another deal. I don't know.</p>

<p>Our attorney who Jess met through the mediation certification, he gave me an idea about, you know, our blog is not on the Web site. I need to get the blog on the Web site. [00:23:01]</p>

<p>But he said to use Google Alerts to find articles and blog posts about things I would write about and to basically cut and paste it from Word and do a track changes on it. So, you know, you change it up enough that it's not plagiarism or whatever, you know.</p>

<p>And I did one this weekend on Sunday and I had it timed to I thought, 9:30 in the morning, but it did it four hours before that. So obviously it's not Eastern Standard Time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So - but I'm going to try and do more of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you have analytics on there? Like can you see who's hitting a site and where they're going and all of that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know like I'm out - there's two phone numbers on there that get routed to my number. There's an 800 number which I - we're going to - I want to change to get routed to the other number. [00:24:10]</p>

<p>But I feel bad talking to those people because I'm behind on my payments. That's another thing that I owe money on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And, you know, I'm kind of pissed that the guy hasn't contacted me to put in the new pages, but we've just got to work on getting that up and running, you know. But so I can tell through caller ID who's used those phone numbers and I'll be able to tell if this woman who found me; whether she, you know, found us through the Web site or not, so I can tell what number she called in from.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like I talked to the woman on Friday and Jess asked me yesterday when we were drafting the engagement letter, you know, I really didn't have a good one for this type of - I had a fee agreement and then some estate planning engagement letters. [00:25:23]</p>

<p>But I kind of had this draft of my own for the just normal other stuff. Instead of doing a fee agreement if I could just draft it, I said. "Did you get the money from them yet?"</p>

<p>I didn't think I had this set for 7:30. Oh, my seven o'clock has been switched to 7:30.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I kind of miss the reggae (inaudible at 00:25:57)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I can't put that on there. Well what happens is the program is not open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It uses the regular alarm which kind of defeats the purpose, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I spent money; 99 cents for this program. Maybe I can find one that will - it's like when I go to bed I can leave it open which I thought I did last night and it didn't work this morning, so I'm a little ticked off with it.</p>

<p>So I switched then to using the Cloud and I didn't realize that long story short, I basically had triple, I tripled all my appointments. So I had to go back and start deleting stuff. And, you know, I have a lot of birthdays that like Facebook has put in there.</p>

<p>And so, you know, I've been in the process of deleting those as they approach but it just is a nightmare, you know. [00:27:13]</p>

<p>I wasted a good portion yesterday of - I could have been doing some title work and I'm probably trying to do more today, but that really is going to make my life a lot easier, you know. Because by loading iTunes, it doesn't load quickly and it takes a little while and then you've got to synch it and you've got to - you know, there's just all these steps you've got to go through.</p>

<p>And I wouldn't do it for a few days and then one appointment wouldn't be, you know, on either my phone or on the computer and I'd freak out. And now it's like it's instantaneous. As soon as I put an appointment there, you know, it's online. [00:28:03]</p>

<p>So I can check it online if I'm like (inaudible at 00:28:07) just and have Internet access, but not my phone or, you know. And see, I've got a little tool to have it work without Outlook.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that I didn't even know because it's like, you know. And that was kind of part of I did the synch before I knew - I did the iCloud before I know I had this option to use this program, you know, and then I just - a fucking waste of time.</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>So getting that new client has made me a little less anxious. [00:29:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Good.</p>

<p>(Coughing)</p>

<p>CLIENT: As you probably can tell.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah, you sound a little more upbeat, like a little bit of (inaudible at 00:29:22)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Two more people are leaving the E&G Group.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh gosh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: One guy is joining and then the photographer is leaving. You know, I've got to get up for this meeting today to (inaudible at 00:29:43), that's really why I never went to them because they were all (inaudible at 00:29:46).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yep.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And the Chamber of Commerce moved in to the (inaudible at 00:29:53) center so it's actually going to be at their shop. So, you know, I mean I can't believe for seven or eight years I haven't gone to one.</p>

<p>I went to the golf tournament one year because of my banker back then took me. You know other than that, I haven't done a single Chamber event. I've basically paid my membership so I can get cheap health insurance.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's like well, I really should use this, you know. You know it's going to be like E&G is going to take me a while to really, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:30:39) is a really big deal. You left how many big referrals (inaudible at 00:30:43)? There's Ray, at Bristol Bank...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Bristol Bank.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...and even though you didn't lose Claire but you kind of lost her for the last year.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Levi and those guys kind of fell off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Levi, but Levi did send me a closing. He's a realtor but does more accessing than he does realtoring. I don't know. [00:31:19]</p>

<p>It's my one - I mean first of all there's the chance that my dad and step mom will say sorry, we can't lend you the money.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I know there's a little bit left in the insurance policy, maybe 1,000 bucks. And so there's some dear projection there, but there's also what if I'm in this position two months from now; four months from now, next winter. [00:32:00]</p>

<p>I just - I mean because we're going to have to send money to the IRS every month, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think Jess is finding ways to, you know, get more paying clients. And I mean she made over - she made $6,200.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's great.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And once she starts getting the mediations - and plus she has clients who aren't paying her, you know. She has one client who owes her a chunk of money. And she's been doing work for her and, I don't know. [Pause]</p>

<p>I just got, if I have a good month I've got to, you know, put the money away for months I don't have good months. [00:33:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I don't know if I'm capable of.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which I don't know if I'm capable of, you know. If my dad sends me just 1,000 bucks I could fix my car. That's the first thing which has got to be fixed. I imagine that's going to be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 you know.</p>

<p>[Pause]</p>

<p>I'm really hoping something turns around. At E&G during this visitor's day where everybody sends out 40 letters, I'm supposed to follow up on the phone with these letters. [00:34:10]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow, with all of them?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And yeah. And you're supposed to send like ten a week over the course of a month.</p>

<p>And we had planned our visitor day for the end of March which screws up the timeline and means we have to do them all in one week. So I've suggested that we move the date of the visitor day so that we can, you know, make it easier on people and, you know, make sure everybody is doing their ten letters.</p>

<p>I've done it before. Years and years ago we did it and we really weren't that successful in getting new members.</p>

<p>I think E&G though is more - people know about it more now than they used to, you know, seven years ago; six years ago. [00:35:04]</p>

<p>And so it may work better, you know. People, I don't know - people have really got to do it and actually do the letters, you know. And I'm hoping that they just slowly creep back up to 20, getting to the 20s again, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What have you got now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: God, now we've got to do below 15, you know, which is really bad because now it's people non-renewing so they drop off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And so E&G sees that we're low, you know, one of the things the Assistant Director told me, he said they force us to have a morning meeting which means I'd be getting up at, you know, five in the morning to get to this 7:30 meeting. And just like I said, I have to get used to that. [00:36:12]</p>

<p>The mortgage guy lives in Franklin so he's in the same boat, he's just as far away from where the meeting is. So I don't know, that's the one sort of wild card out there that, you know. If the group fell apart and I'd really be in trouble, I don't know if I could keep this relationship going with this mortgage broker company, you know, I keep sending them business.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But really, I've just got to start doing more. There's like this internal fear of, you know, going to the Chamber. And, you know, I don't know why just, it's like everything is why I don't want to make phone calls and all the little things I don't want to do. I'm not really sure why. It's my shy side. [00:37:49]</p>

<p>And plus, you know, with the Chamber a lot of these people work in the Center so I'd see them all the time, which I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, you know; probably a good thing.</p>

<p>The more people see you and the more your name is out there, the better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you (inaudible at 00:38:12) you know, you're just kind of building back up the confidence that you used to have I think, for doing that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>I know you haven't done Chamber events and things like that but if I'm remembering right, you used to do sort of more networking. And even if, you know, you had to overcome some shyness, like it wasn't too bad.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And like, you know, it truly takes some time to get back there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I e-mailed this banker who had referred me. He never responded to my e-mail. I sent him an e-mail again following up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know the reality is I should probably call him. But, you know, I'm not excited about the why. I just don't know why. [00:39:03]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What would the conversation be like when you called him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I mean it would be a lot about what he does and what he's trying to do and what I do and, you know, probably it could be just a brief kind of overview of our businesses. And then we'll schedule coffee or something and at coffee he'll tell me how he's already got plenty of attorneys that he's using.</p>

<p>You know, I should send him some deals and then he'll think about putting me on his list. The same old, same old, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And for some reason he seems to be avoiding that? I mean in other words like it sounds like it's going to feel kind of crummy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's like I used to do lunches but that was expensive buying people lunches. [00:40:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So if I'm going to get rejected it might as well be a cup of coffee. So, you know, but still last night I did smoke some pot at Jess's.</p>

<p>I just tore through my food that I had just bought a bunch of food at the store and it was all fruits and vegetables except for like a can of peanut butter. But last night I mean, I ate this spinach salad and I was full, and I still went and had two pieces of bread.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I went and had two more pieces of bread with peanut butter on them. You know, so it's like I'm just - it's good because I'm eating healthier which, you know, will have beneficial effects just from... [00:41:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I would imagine it's, you know, it's more about comforting yourself for being anxious than about being hungry, you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yeah. And the good thing is that like some food - oh, and I had a bowl of cereal as well. You know, it's just I'm not eating all day and then all of a sudden well this is why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:41:38) you start to think - I mean like you start to lay all that stuff out or start thinking about it, you know, all you have to do; being worried about it, you know, what it's going to take to do it, and how a lot of it can be difficult. You know, like it makes you anxious.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What I was going to say is I don't eat all day. You know like I had this thing of string cheese and that's why it was bad to just have one big meal. [00:42:13]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know. But I haven't really, you know - coffee has been my breakfast and my lunch. I forgot to get bananas. So maybe I'll have an apple or an orange this morning.</p>

<p>Well I've got to go to the office because I've got to send out this engagement letter so I've got to - so I'll spend some time in the office this morning and do some title work, you know. [00:43:00]</p>

<p>I've got to figure out how to - I don't know. I could call Tracy and ask her if there is any money up there waiting for me in my mail.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But that's, you know, once again, you know, Tracy who I can't get out of a conversation with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. Like everything in my life, it's broken, you know. That's the way I feel. There's nothing, you know, the car is broken, and my marriage is broken, my dog is broken, my work is broken. I'm not keeping in shape; that's broken, though I did bring my bike upstairs yesterday. [00:44:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, good.</p>

<p>[Coughing]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I picked up Ian' mattress and maybe today I'll take a ride on the bike.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Carrying the baby around for 45 minutes yesterday (inaudible at 00:44:29).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: … how to recognize and how to identify and assist the students in distress.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yup.</p>

<p>CLIENT: We are doing our second presentation for faculty members. So I’m kinda nervous about it, but I’m sure it’ll be fine.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay, yeah. Cool.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I passed my jurisprudence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right!</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm. One more thing [overtalk].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Licensed. What do you gotta do now? That’s it, right?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, it’s the final… it’s like paperwork. Like give me your credit card number over the phone so you can be licensed.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hey, that’s awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. That felt different than the EPPP. Like it really feels like, wow, that’s the end. No more [overtalk].</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s it. There’s not… Yeah. Yeah, you’re done.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s awesome.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That was fun.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then they make you… you have to pay again in June?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ve been hearing mixed things about that. One of my friends who got licensed after January said, “No, we don’t, I asked.” And then someone else at work told me yes you do. So I don’t know, I’m just going to have to call. I’m going to have to call what’s her name, Nina Hobart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Nina Hobart. She’s still at the helm, huh?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. She’s… it’s kinda scary to call her. Because she’s busy, she’s a busy woman, so every time I’ve called like she sounds really irritated. [laughter] Like, “How do you not know this?” Because she’s probably asked like fifty times a day. So that was good. What else? I’m at the same I was last week as far as my complicated relationships. Just saw Brian last night, Brian spent the night. And I’m seeing James tonight. This is ridiculous, I’m like leading two different lives. And the thing is I don’t even… it bothers me that I don’t feel badly about it. [0:02:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel? How do you feel about it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think I’m completely devoid of emotion. Like I’m just keeping them separate. I know how I feel about Brian, I know how I feel about James. And I know that with James this is just… it’s new, it’s a new relationship. You know, it’s not that serious, it’s not like I’ve said I love you or planned a future together. It’s just starting. But I’ve noticed that I become irritated with James. Like remember the aggression thing we talked about last time? I saw him on Saturday. So after taking my exam and stuff we had planned… I mean, he was so sweet, he was like, “Come over and I’m going to treat you and take you out, we’re gonna celebrate.” So got to his place and he was, you know, so excited for me and giving me a hug. And then started off the night by going across the street to this little hole in the wall bar from his house that they have like $1.50 beers and these characters. Like he lives in Bunker Hill, so these characters come in. Like there was this woman that was totally intoxicated, and like yelling on the phone threatening to kill someone. Like it’s just like the Jerry Springer show. But we just sit in a corner and laugh and drink our cheap beer. But there was something about… I don’t know if it was that woman, like that she was so obnoxious and drunk, or if it was him, but I found myself… like before we ordered our beers and we sat down I got like annoyed with him. And he wasn’t doing anything, he was just being himself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did you find… yeah, what was it, what did you find annoying?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was just like sweet and understanding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was a weird reaction. Like I felt like slapping him, being like, “Toughen up!” [0:04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh! Toughen up, yeah?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like he wasn’t doing anything wrong.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But then…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But toughen up. No, but what about the sweet… how was the sweet and the… What did you call it, sweet and what else?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like caring.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You were gonna say something.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, now I remember. I was… I was in the car listening to music, and I was in a really good mood, because I was like, “Oh my God, it’s over, last text.” So I was blasting a lot of like my Jamaica music, like my hip hop music. And I was like bouncing around in the car and hyper and wanted to get there. And I guess like when I saw him I was just like, he’s kinda boring. But he’s not. I don’t know why I started thinking that, but I did. Like I was in this party mood kind of thing. And…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was like, you’re bringing my party down like.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I didn’t even know what he had planned for the night. He could have planned something. Like because he was… he told me when I got there, he’s like, “I have something special planned.” And after having a few beers at the bar he’s like, “Okay, I’m going to tell you what I have planned. After this I was planning to take you to that fancy restaurant again that I took you for Valentine’s Day because I know you really liked it.” And this place is like $32 per meal. So you get that, you get beers, you get an appetizer, it adds up. And I like really felt like having a laid back kind of night, if anything, like music in the background, laughing, having bar food and beers, and he had planned this fancy night. But I told him like in a very sweet, gentle way, and I was like, “That’s lovely.” Like, “Wow, that’s really sweet, I did love that place. But what do you think of…” You know. And he was totally down for it too. And that made me happy, that he was flexible. And as I started drinking more then I got all sweet on him. So it changed, it flipped very quickly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:06:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: But yeah, we ended up going to this like sports bar type of place with music. And oh my God, we got like buffalo chicken nachos. You know, just like all this junk. But that’s what I wanted to do. And the conversation, it’s always so easy with him. Like it amazes me that… just we could be anywhere and we always come up with things to talk about and we always laugh. I don’t remember feeling that ease so much on any of the dates I went on. And even with Brian, like there’s nothing to talk about sometimes. He’s just so weird. He’s just so not in touch with his feelings, or not wanting to talk about anything, and he just sits there in silence. And I’m like, “What are you thinking right now?”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like if you guys are out to eat or something?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And if he does talk about something it’s like his martial arts.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not necessarily something I’m that interested in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But with James it’s like, God, we talk about everything.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, but it’s… yeah, there’s… I could see though that there’s like… that something about James kind of elicits a kind of a… I don’t know if it’s right to call it anxiety, but unfamiliarity I would say more than anything else. Like some sort of sense of like, I don’t know that I like this that you sort of…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was going to call it a frustration.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A frustration. Yeah. Yeah, toughen up. Is that the frustration, toughen up?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, but he wasn’t… he was just sitting there and smiling and being sweet.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like what do I want him to do, treat me like garbage?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel like you want him to do? If you could put it into words, right. [0:08:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know, be Brian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Be Brian. Which would be what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don’t want Brian.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But which would be like what? In that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It should be more anxiety provoking and awkward and uncomfortable. It’s almost like I was angry with him for taking me out to celebrate. Maybe it goes back to this thing of I don’t deserve this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I couldn’t have planned for a better night, you know. Like I’ve been waiting for ever for someone… How many times have I accomplished anything big and Brian wasn’t there to celebrate anything? Even if celebrating meant coming over and spending the night, or having dinner at home. And here’s James like, “I’m gonna take you out and we’re gonna celebrate.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like everything I’ve been waiting for, and then when I have it it frustrates me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, there is just something though that it’s like… it’s interesting that it’s opening up I think another… some realm of feeling though. I don’t know what it is, just… yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Another thing I noticed is that I am completely not jealous when James tells me about past relationships and sexually related stuff. But I’m very jealous, but I don’t express it. But I’ve noticed myself becoming jealous and uncomfortable when he talks about loving or caring or thinking that that was really special. Like emotional stuff with other women. And I’ve noticed with him… like I guess since it doesn’t bother me, the sexual stuff, I’ve like blurted out things before like to be funny or something, and he’s joked with me and smiled and been like, “I’m getting really kind of jealous right now.” So that stuff bothers him. [0:10:00]</p>

<p>And I was just thinking about this in the car. So it seems like James is very much… for as long as… since after college it seems like he’s the kind of guy that really wants to be in a relationship. And he once told me that basically everyone he’s every slept with has been his girlfriend. I was like, “Damn, you’ve had a lot of girlfriends.” You know, because he told me he’s slept with like about 30 women or something. And he’s like, “Well, no, some of them were just like casual hookups, not really girlfriends, but I would sleep with them more than once.” And I’m like, “Still, you’ve been in a lot of relationships.” And I found myself a little bit jealous because like I don’t have that experience I guess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it also seems like he very much loves love, and wants to be in love. And this started coming up for me when he showed me his dissertation. So it was like this book all binded up, and I started reading the dedications. And it named like his family and his friends, but then it said, “And absolutely I want to thank my girlfriend and best friend,” and some name. And so I was like, “Hey, so is she still your best friend?” And he starts laughing, and he’s like, “I don’t even talk to her anymore.” I’m like, “Oh. She must have been very special to you at the time.” And he’s like, “Oh my God, I can’t believe I put that in.” Like, “Why did I do that?” And I was like, “Well, I mean, it makes sense. At the time you considered her very important to you and your best friend.” And he’s like, “Yeah, why did I do that?”</p>

<p>And then I’ve heard him… like I started remembering things he said about other past girlfriends, like, “Oh, she was my best friend.” So I started just asking him questions about like, “So would you say that every girlfriend you’ve been with has pretty much been your best friend?” He was like, “Well, yeah, I guess at the time when I’m with them it feels like a best friend.” And I’m like, “And like with how many of them did you feel like you had the potential for a future with them?” And then he started laughing and saying, “I’m feeling a little bit judged right now.” And I could see how that might feel like that. And I was like, “No, but seriously. I’m sorry, like if you’re feeling judged you don’t have to answer anything. But I was just curious because I just… I’ve noticed that it seems like you’re very much… you want to be in love, and that’s something that you crave and that you really desire. And it seems like in a lot of your relationships you very much wanted that.” And he said, “No, that’s accurate.” [0:12:30]</p>

<p>And I’ve noticed that I try very hard with males I’m with to feel… I want to feel different and special in some way. So I found myself asking Brian things last night. Like he brought up again how he’s sleeping with other women. And although I didn’t want to hear details about it, it made me feel better when I asked him, “Even though you do that with them, it’s different, right? Like what we do is special and different? Like you don’t say the same things to them, you don’t do the same things?” And he assured me, he’s like, “Of course not. Like everybody’s different, they wouldn’t want to say the things that we say or do. Like of course it’s different.” And for some reason that made me feel so much better, like oh, I’m special.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it’s the same thing I think with James. Because he keeps saying things to me like, “This feels different.” And sometimes I think like, “You probably say this to all the girlfriends you’re with, because you just want it so bad.” You know. And he’s like… I told him the story about how Kevin proposed. And so he kind of made a little joke, he’s like, “So you’d prefer it if I asked your mother for permission if I ever asked you to marry me?” You know, so he’s abuse already talking about stuff like this. But I’m finding myself kind of doubting. Like is it really about me, or is it just that this guy wants to be married and wants to be in love so much that… So I think that’s pissing me off a little bit. [0:14:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, what does he… Well, yeah, some kind of question about like, yeah, what are his motives. Who’s this guy really about? What’s this guy really about?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What’s he really feel towards a woman? Is he really going to see me? And in some ways—I think you’ve been describing—in some ways, you know, he’s getting to know sides of you gradually over time. And that he doesn’t know the whole story.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And I think that that’s why I don’t feel terrible about what I’m doing with Brian yet, because it’s just starting. You know, he doesn’t know all of me. [pause] I was about to say something and I forgot. [pause] I can’t remember, I blanked out. Um…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What… Yeah, I want to know what you blanked out on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. I just suddenly felt really judged. And it’s nothing you did.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did I do? Yeah, tell me.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s nothing you did, I’m just like listening… I’m listening to myself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, go ahead, what?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I sound… I sound like a selfish whore.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About… maybe in some way what I might have been thinking about this situation?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like because I heard myself say, “Well, I think that I’m feeling like it’s okay what I’m doing with Brian because James doesn’t fully know me yet.” But that’s not a good reason to be unfaithful. [pause] But I can’t help it. Like I’m not going to stop doing what I’m doing, I feel no need to. And Brian is like upping the ante. He’s more dominant and more dirty that ever. And I think that he’s… I almost see it like he’s doing these things to like draw me in. He said something last night like, “I’m so scared that you’re going to be with this guy for some time and finally realize that you can’t keep doing this with me.” I’m scared of that too. [pause] [laughs] [0:16:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, what? What are you thinking? What?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It sounds terrible?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What are you hearing? What are you hearing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can’t believe I’m laughing about this. Brian paid me for sex last night.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s what I mean by he’s like making it worse and dirtier and like pushing boundaries. It’s all like fun and games.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What was it about? What was it about though? How did this money come into it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know, he just introduced that over the phone like a week ago or something, playing around with the idea. Like depending on how long I can last or what I can give him. And he knows I need money for my license. [laughs]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, so is that kind of the [overtalk]?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think it’s got two meanings. Like it’s a sexual turn on, but also I think he ultimately wants to help me out however he can. And I think that he would feel bad saying like, “Here’s $275.” You know, so it’s kind of like a playful way to I want to help you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah, okay. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: At least that’s how I’m thinking about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So 275, that’s the…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I only got 70 last night. [laughing]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You only got 70.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [0:18:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What, was that part of it, like he was going to give you only so much money? Or is it like…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, we have like… we have like rules. Like every condom is worth ten dollars, if you do this or this that’s worth fifty.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And see like first of all James, it’s just a whole different…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That’s… yeah. Well, that’s…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I’ve been trying to go there with him for different things, but it’s just so not the same. Like I’m convinced I Brian never find another person like Brian. He is just… I don’t think that any normal person could be like him, I think you have to have his like psychological composition and drama history to be the way he is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It just like… it doesn’t even feel like playing around. Like you know how with some… Like with James sometimes it can seem silly, like he’s trying to put on a role. Like when I ask him to be a little bit more dominant or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But with Brian it just comes so natural. Like it’s just that’s him, that’s who he is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He’s really… it’s very, um, accessible. With James it’s not, it’s not as accessible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. And I still… I spent all weekend with him pretty much and still could not orgasm. And I played around with trying to make him tell me to do things, which was turning me on. And after he was done like he was done. Like that’s it, like he was ready to go take a shower and get ready for the day. Like Brian would never do that. First of all, Brian doesn’t ejaculate. Like he Brian go four hours and make sure that I have lost count, and then he’ll go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. [0:20:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: He’s a freak.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh. Oh, so he… it’s not like he’ll ejaculate and then he’ll start up again. It’s more that he’ll just keep going [overtalk].</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. He can just hold on to it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah. Oh, it’s so much more than just getting off then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes! Yeah, absolutely. So…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, wow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like so every time…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … it’s a lot to it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So every time I’m with James it’s like…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And to you too. There’s something about it for you too, it’s a whole kind of…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, yeah. And he’s always… like with the things he says, like he’s like, you know, “I don’t care if this hurts you. I like this, this feels good to me.” But ultimately he’s not coming, I am. So I know it’s in… the purpose is to pleasure me, you know. Even though he does that whole dominant thing, like, “I don’t care, I’m just using you.” Because he knows that turns me on. It’s just I can’t recreate this with anyone. And I think I’m gonna have to… I feel like I have to choose one or the other. Or maybe it’s too soon. It is too soon. James is learning. He’s doing little things. And he even… he’s in therapy, and he’s… we even talk about like what we share in therapy. I mean, I obviously don’t share the whole stuff with him. But he has told me like, “Oh yeah, I’ve told my therapist just about how you wanted me to do different things in bed, and how I was resistant at first, but then I tried it and I really like it.” So I’m like introducing himself to new things that… You know. So I can’t expect him to change overnight.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. Yeah. Yeah, no, but I hear it, there’s… I mean, he offers something very different. And I guess what I hear you say is like what… what… this sense of like can sex have the meaning it has with Brian if it takes a form that’s very different. You know, what kind of… what Brian James offer in terms of a meaningful connection, yeah, through sex? Is he gonna offer something that feels very important and deep to you? Yeah. [0:22:40]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There’s these tender moments with James when we’re just close together and we’re kissing, and it feels so tender and so nice. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that with anyone before. Like maybe with Kevin when I was like really young and naïve and… I think I caught glimpses of that. Like I’m talking about when we were in high school. With Brian I don’t feel that, because he’s just so cut off emotionally. He doesn’t even like to kiss. Like he’s just so stiff. Like I remember last night trying to just start just being very sweet with him and hugging him and he’ll just like be like that while I’m hugging him. He won’t hug me back. And like James just wraps his arms completely around me, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that feels really good, but in a different way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And not that there’s not those tender moments with Brian, because in between all this debauchery like there’s moments of real connection and sweetness and tenderness, and him telling me I love you, that feel very passionate. But passionate in a different, like passionate from some romance novel or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Huh! Like what… yeah, tell me what’s that. [0:24:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know, like I think of these old romance novels from the 80s with like the man with the long hair and the woman. You know, like those type fantasy or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But with James it’s just a lot more tender. It’s like a romantic comedy.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, yeah. But…</p>

<p>CLIENT: More real.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: More real, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, there’s… yeah, there’s something important about that distinction. You know, just one thought I had about it all is that… I was thinking that with Brian, and maybe it’s true for you and Brian, there’s a kind of a comfort in going back and forth between the tenderness and the kind of the dominant/submission thing. There’s a way that he needs that to get into the tenderness, just similar to you, there’s a way that you need that kinda level of raw… almost like it’s… there’s like a brutal quality to it, interspersed with tenderness.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And yet it makes it more palatable or something like that for you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whenever he… like whenever he’s called me to have phone sex, or he wants to come over, or something like that. And sometimes like I’ve shamed him for it, because let’s say we’ve been in an argument and I’m like, “You don’t want to talk this out. Like we can’t just have sex and that’s the way to fix it.” He’ll… it’s almost like I shame him and I see him put his head down, and he’s like, “Well, I wanted to feel closer to my pet.” That’s what he always says. I mean, that’s what he uses to get close. So I think that you’re right when you say like that he needs that—or maybe we both do—that kind of brutalness, and then it goes into the tenderness. [0:26:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: See I was thinking about that, as like something about when James was being sweet you wanted to slap him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or I wanted to be mean to him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, you wanted that… it didn’t sound… it was like almost as a way… I wonder if it’s even a way if you can kinda… it’s a way to kind of have the tenderness. You know, because of something that the tenderness evokes in you, if you bring in the slap…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Aggression.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: … you bring in the aggression, the brutal side of it, the tenderness can still stick around somehow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I really felt like insulting him or making him feel little, like belittling him or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. What… do you have any sense of what you wanted to say?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Nothing specifically, but I just remember sitting at the bar with him and like feeling bigger and better than him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hm. Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like now that I’m thinking about it, it reminds me of how Brian tries to feel with me. You know, like he’s bigger and better.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes! Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I don’t… like in my relationship with James it feels like I’m playing Brian and James is playing me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don’t like that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why, what’s it like, what do you mean?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know, I guess because I prefer to be dominated. You know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, okay. You don’t like to be the one in the dominating… [0:28:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel more dominating with James. I have to tell him what to do. Or he asks me for permission or… it just doesn’t come naturally. But I feel like everything else is so good. Like we get along so well, and he’s hilarious. And I told him the other day, like nobody makes me laugh this hard except like my little sisters and my mom. Like I laugh all the time, you know, at work, with friends, but like those deep laughs that I like want to pee my pants, that’s what I have with James.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. Yeah, it’s really a connection.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it feels so good.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So I know he’s special. I don’t have any of that with Brian. Like even yesterday in the in between moments when I was trying to be sweet with him and just talk with him, I was asking, “So how’s Logan? Anything new, any new pictures?” He wouldn’t even show me any pictures, and just one-word answers, like, “Mm hm. He’s good. Mm hm.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s just lacking all that other stuff. And… Like when he talks to me about how I ran off and I’m fucking someone else, and I’m like, “This isn’t about sex. Like all those things that I want from you, like meet my friends and go out with me and do things with me and make plans with me, he’s giving me those things.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. But he hears it as a kind of a… as his inadequacy, his… Brian does?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, there’s no way… he doesn’t see himself as inadequate. At least not… All he’s focused on is like the sexual stuff. You know, like I don’t think it has even registered in his mind like where he’s lacking emotionally. Like maybe that this guy’s providing something emotionally for me that he can’t. [0:30:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, that’s… yeah, that’s what I was sensing. Like is it his inadequacy as a lover in some way, is that what he imagines?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He could never… I mean, no way. Brian thinks he’s the best.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. How does he get… what does he have to say about you running off with another lover to have sex with? He sees it as…</p>

<p>CLIENT: He tries to get me to say things. Like, “Tell me about it.” And I’ve said very few vague things. He knows that it’s not the same, he knows that I don’t have orgasms, he knows… You know, so that makes him feel great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Hm. Yeah. I wonder if in some way… you know, you were talking about this kind of… this feeling of not having a lot of feelings about it, about seeing Brian, and then this kind of… you know, I was thinking this sort of tension came over you around like, well, how does that sound and how do I…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm hm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess one thought I have is… and it’s not that it’s the whole thing, because there’s obviously a lot between Brian and you just in its own right. But I was thinking in some way if there’s some way that like… that to have… maybe why it doesn’t feel so bad in one way is because it feels like it’s an important aspect of what you’re doing to James in some way. Not in the sense of like… I don’t think of it in terms of hurting him because you want to be cool, but more along the lines of like wanting him to be like… [pause] … like it’s almost like a slap in the face that you want to have towards him. [0:32:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: A slap in the face to him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To James.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like slap his face?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s almost like… you know, almost like to have another level like a slap in his face or something like that. And I mean that in a sense of like some side of you that goes, “I don’t want to lose something that happens with Brian and I.” This kind of, “I want you to know something about me.” You know, that, “I want to push you on the rocks, I want to…” Something that you feel I think is something important that you don’t want to lose.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To lose.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And in that way… I know I’m not doing a great job of explaining it maybe, but like I was thinking about in the context of the relationship with James it’s a side that you end up maybe feeling like… it’s some way of like… I was thinking about it similarly to Brian saying, “I have more lovers than just you.” Like what it means to him to have that. It’s analogous for you in some way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s powerful.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s powerful, and I think maybe because of something that gets evoked between you and James.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. You know, it just came to mind that… I don’t know if this has anything to do with it, but I’ve been having a lot of insecurity around my intelligence around James lately. I kept making jokes, and I didn’t realize this but he pointed it out to me. I think it’s because he did a lot better on the EPPP than I did, and my friend Carly did a lot better than either one of us. And I know it doesn’t matter, like you pass, you pass, nobody’s ever going to look at that again. And they both shared that they got like a 90 on the jurisprudence, and I got an 85. And so I walk through the door and he’s like, “Yay, good job!” And he’s like, “So what’d you get?” And I was like… the first thing I said was, “Well, you know, not as good as you and Carly, but I got an 85.” He’s like, “Why are you saying that?” And I just make jokes like, “Well, you know, you’re whitey and I’m a colored person, and so I’m an immigrant and we don’t do as well on tests.” Like just throwing out random stuff like that. And he stops me, he’s like, “You’ve been saying that a lot lately. What’s going on?” And I started remembering, I’m like, “Oh, I have been putting myself down.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. [0:34:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I’m looking at his dissertation. Remember… I don’t know if you remember when we had to talk about our dissertations.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then my school didn’t really require an official one, so I felt like a cheat or something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And like both his parents are educated. Like his dad’s a psychologist, mom’s a mental health counselor, they both went to Ivy League schools. His… I think before… he has uncles and stuff that work for the government. Like he comes from a smart family. Here I am with my father who cuts vegetables and my mom who makes nine bucks an hour at a preschool, and I feel like unequal.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, not outright. I know… And he tells me all the time, like, “I would not be with a person that I don’t think is smart, and I think that you’re very smart.” But maybe that is playing a part, like because it makes me powerful. Well, at least I’m better than you or I’m more experienced than you in this realm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that’s right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Or a part of it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think there’s something… Yeah, I think there’s a lot… And this feeling I think too of something… I don’t know if it’s unequal quite, but some way that you really felt really, um… disquieted I guess is the word maybe about him having these special bonds with these women. Like in a way… [0:36:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, what I just thought of is like, well, look how pathetic, I’ve only had Kevin, which was like a juvenile relationship. But Brian, that was my powerful, passionate love, and I can’t let go of that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it’s not even over yet, you know. Like I don’t know how it ends.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Yeah, no, and… You know, it’s interesting now that I’m thinking of it. I imagine Brian feels a lot of these kind of ways with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what he told me the other day that was really a surprise? He said, “I’ve never told you this, but besides my wife you’re my longest relationship ever.” And that meant a lot to me, just because I know he’s… he’s not only slept with a lot of women, but he had been in a lot of relationships before his wife. And that felt special in some way. [pause] He repeated that again last night. It just feels… it feels so dysfunctional. It’s like a mind fuck whenever I’m with him, because like I’m crying, and then I’m upset, and then I’m totally into it and… It’s a mess.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. What… yeah, tell… what hap… yeah, tell me about the…</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like depending on what we talk about. Like if he starts telling me about, “Yeah, two days ago I was with someone else.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And this’ll all be during sex? Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s how we communicate. I noticed that last night. Like we were having a whole conversation. And… yeah, and then I resist, I don’t want to hear it. And then he tries to push me, like, “Yes you do, it’ll turn you on. Ask me about it, I know you want to know.” Like he messes with my mind I feel like. But I’m allowing him to. And then ultimately it feels good. [0:38:05]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm hm. Hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I start crying, I don’t want to hear, and he’s like, “Aren’t you the woman who just had sex this morning?” Because I was over at James’ house Sunday morning. This was Sunday that Brian came over at night. He’s like, “Don’t be a hypocrite.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What did that… He said that in reference to what? Why did he say that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because he had slept with someone else two days ago and here I am crying.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Okay, okay. So you were really hurt, you got really hurt, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like he’s like, “Don’t be hurt, don’t start crying. You’re the one who just…”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then what happens? Then what happens when he says that to you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I stop crying. And then I feel guilty. And I kept saying, “You’re right.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh boy.</p>

<p>CLIENT: “Let me get off on this. Let’s make this erotic instead.”</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, and how Brian it become erotic?</p>

<p>CLIENT: So then… I don’t know, it’s just like I shift the way my mind is in that moment and I’m like using rational thinking, like, yes, he’s right, you were just having sex with someone else last week… I mean earlier today. Think about how he must feel. His feelings are hurt. He’s not showing it, but his feelings have to be hurt. So how can you sit here and… You need to be punished. Like so you need to hear it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm, okay. So going from sad and hurt to feeling like you need to be… you deserve to be punished.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then that turns me on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That turns you on. And Brian the sex then be… have that kind of punitive quality to it, that he’s punish… it’s a… [0:40:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think… I mean, the pain is always there, because I’ve told you he’s like very rough. But whatever he’s saying to me Brian have a punitive quality.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It’s what he’s saying, okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if he’ll describe like who he was with or what he did. Then it’s like breaking my heart.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: [inaudible], wow. Yeah, there’s a lot there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know that when I’m doing this, like the healthy side of me is saying like, “This is so unhealthy. This is so messed up.” I mean…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, it’s really though I guess reaching into something inside of you very… That’s the…</p>

<p>CLIENT: What else has ever… no one else has ever tapped into whatever that is, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it’s kind of been your way of talking about it here. And I think it’ll be good for you to be able to talk about what is kinda getting, you know, turned up in that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You know what’s funny that I just thought of? The only other thing that I could compare it to—but it’s completely opposed, because it’s almost like the angel and the devil—is therapy. The experience I’ve had with you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, well, what do you know, what do you know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because like I’ve been able to be open and feel and really delve into really raw things that normally I don’t like to think about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that’s the only thing I can compare it to. And I don’t know why that makes me cry. But it’s like this is good, and this is healthy, and that’s completely messed up. But it taps into similar things I guess. You know, things that other people can’t tap into for whatever. [0:42:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and in this… and in this atmosphere there’s like a lack of the… there’s an absence of kind of the sexual or erotic. Are you… you obviously haven’t talked about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’ve told you that I can’t do that, because then it would feel like fake, or not special, or it would… it would take away something.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm. Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I couldn’t picture you as a real person—at least when I’m in here I can’t picture you as a real person outside in the world, not that much older than me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because then you could potentially like, “Oh, I could have dated you.” And that would… no, don’t go there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ah. Huh, huh. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s like that time that remember my mom met you, and she said like, “Oh, you should date him.” And then I came in here and told you about it and I just started weeping. Because it was almost like she was taking… it felt like with that comment she was taking away that this was special, you know. [breaking down crying]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm, mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Is this totally about me not even… not being able to integrate the two? Is that what this is about? Like I have to keep them separate?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think it’s yeah, put… you know, I think it’s a lot about first of all you really trying to put a lot of yourself together. Really. You know, how much of the good, the bad as you say, the sexual, the erotic. How… the sense of it being special and pure. And all that stuff, and how complicated all that is. How that’s so hard and challenging to put it all together. But a lot that you’re trying to kinda shed light on in yourself, and kinda have… that’s not separated into kinda compartments. It’s not compartmentalized experience. [0:44:30]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It’s funny how like I don’t expect certain things to make me cry, and then they make me cry. It’s weird.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. What did you notice about the… what was making you kinda sad?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don’t know. Like it… [pause] I guess because this relationship does mean a lot to me, and it’s been like the one like corrective experience with a man that I’ve had, and I would never want to ruin it by even entertaining, you know, the idea that you are an actual human man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How about that. Hm. It threatens something, huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It threatens something. The specialness of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don’t know what to say about that. But I know I want to go back to that and keep exploring that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah, and you know, it… Yeah, it’s… I see it’s a hard area to get into, a feeling of not wanting to disrupt something that’s…</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don’t know why it brings up tears. Like it’s this sadness, like a loss.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Mm hm, mm hm. [0:46:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That’s what it feels like. [pause] This is interesting work we’re doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Deeper than boring.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I’m glad I ended up working with a man.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, how did you…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I never wanted to. Like the only reason was because I really needed to talk to someone. Because of the Kevin situation, and then Henry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, Henry. Did you ask Henry for a female?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, I just said a therapist.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But it… you see, it’s…</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think he only gave me your name. And I was just like, “Yeah, I’ve never tried it.” But he’s CHA trained, and I was totally like gung ho CHA at the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So I was like, “Yeah, why not.” But I was just not thinking about my relationships with men, you know, and how that…</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. Huh, right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, that’s been a big part of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right? Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, so tomorrow… I mean next week’s not the 17th.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. No, we’re on for the 10th.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

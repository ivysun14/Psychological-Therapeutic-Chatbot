<p>PATIENT:  (3-minute silence) I've been thinking about something that happened this weekend.  And at the time it seemed so important that really after it happened Saturday evening and then I just couldn't think about anything else.  But — for, for the rest of the weekend.  But today it just, well, it puzzles me at how, how unimportant, not unimportant exactly, but just the whole impression of it is vaguer and I don't have any kind of intense reaction to it as I did at first.  And I think it was just a series of things on Saturday that caused it.  But we had gone out to dinner and we were at the home of friends of ours whom we have seen quite often.  And I've always, I think, been sort of envious of the girl because she's a very energetic person and very entertaining and is not shy at all in conversation.  And I'm inclined sometimes to want to criticize her because I think it's mainly due to the fact that I'm envious of her.  She seems so at ease and confident in what she's doing.  But I just had this overwhelming feeling that eve— — there was another couple there who were new to us and they were involved in a variety of things that were all sort of interesting.  And it would seem that your life would be quite stimulating if you were doing these things.  And I don't really know how involved they actually are but it just, again, made me very envious that they were so involved in things and, I don't know, just alive.</p>

<p>And I just had this terrific reaction of, just got worse and worse during the evening until by the time we left — I was sort of repressing it but by the time we left I just felt completely nauseated.  And it was a feeling I used to have in high school.  And I don't know that I've, well, I must have had it other times.  But it just made me think of how I felt so often when I was in high school.  And, I don't know, coupled with this feeling of envy and a feeling that, eh, that I have so often that I might as well not have been there that evening because I didn't change anything by my presence, that I had nothing to add and, if anything, sort of detracted from the evening.  But more than that I had a feeling of sort of slowly losing myself in the evening.  And I, I wasn't really thinking about that part of it until I left.  But then I just had the feeling that I had to keep my arms around myself so I wouldn't lose any more of myself than I'd already lost, that pretty soon I just wouldn't be there at all.  And sort of the feeling of my not feeling myself being there at all and also that nobody else would even notice me or recognize I was there or have any impression of me at all.</p>

<p>And so I ended up feeling sort of desperate, too, that I had to just hang on to what little bit I felt of myself that was left.  And I also had to fight a feeling of becoming critical of all these people that I had really just been envious of.  And I just, I, I don't know whether I wouldn't let myself put it out of my mind or whether it was just so strong and stronger than I can remember for so long that I couldn't put it out of my mind.  But anyhow I did dwell on it.  And, I don't know, I don't remember when I felt so upset for so long.</p>

<p>And MSCZ knew I was upset so later he was trying to make me feel better, well, first just by showing he knew that I was upset but he also I think, feels more and more that instead of turning away from each other as we have been inclined to do, that we should turn toward each other.  And so he wanted just to hold me and have me put my arms around him and I couldn't do it.  I just somehow felt that there was just nothing of me to give to somebody else, there was so little of me for me.  And if I just opened my arms up away from myself then there'd just be nothing.</p>

<p>And I just went on feeling that way Sunday, which surprised me because usually, after sleeping on it I don't retain the same intense feeling.  And I think adding to it was so—, is something about the impression I got when I was administering the test to a group of young girls.  And they, I don't know, it just, I had this very strong feeling that I'd love to be able to be that age again and do my life over again.  And it was more, I wasn't really thinking in terms, oh, I wish I could do it over again when I saw them, as much as just finding something very, well, sort of touching, I don't know.  It was a very emotional reaction I had to seeing them all, feeling that their lives were all ahead.  And I'd been feeling lately very strongly that I'm old and I must have lived about half my life.  And I never used to be thinking in this way.  It's sort of a new feeling for me to be thinking in these terms.  And this was, I think, part of the reaction I had on Saturday too.</p>

<p>ANALYST: How old were the girls about?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Oh, well, they're anywhere from seventh, eighth and ninth grades.  And it wasn't the youngest ones that made me feel this way, it was the ones who were, well, not completely matured either but fairly well along toward what, a mature figure and bearing and so forth.  So th—, I don't know, I could just think of a colt or some young animal of that sort that — but I, it bothered me that, too, that this feeling stayed so long and I, I did think that maybe I was making it stay that long, that somehow I was enjoying being that miserable, that something had happened to make me feel miserable but then I wasn't letting it go.  And, I don't know, I couldn't tell whether I was, that was what was happening or whether when I became so miserable I began to try analyze what had happened and, and trying to see what I could do so I wouldn't have this reaction again.  I, or, or just to experience an emotion which even if it's misery is at least experiencing something. (Pause)</p>

<p>But still, when I talk about it now I can't, the feeling is gone now.  In fact, some of them I just think, well, I made it up and it just sounds ridiculous now.  (Silence) And I think somehow, coupled with this feeling of being old and so much of my life already having been spent, is a feeling that, even as much as I know I would be happier be—, being more involved in things, as long as they were things I was truly interested in, I withdraw from doing that or being more involved with people or being truly interested in people I know already.  And I just withdraw from all this kind of contact.  And it's, I don't know, perhaps it's just because I don't know what I really do want to get into or what I really am interested in.  But it seems to be more than that.  (Pause) I don't quite know how it is but somehow I just seem to want to be involved with myself. (Silence)</p>

<p>And this reaction I have to criticizing other people when I am envious of them in some way has begun to really bother me too.  It just, it's almost like I step outside and despise myself for doing it.  (Pause) And there's something, too, about this feeling of being nothing that I have so that when I can't respond to MSCZ, just in the simplest way, becomes, makes it even more obvious to me that I'm nothing.  I can't even be something to somebody, to one person.  Or it's not, that's not it exactly but I'm so much of a nothing I can't even give to one person, feel something for one person.  (4-minute silence)</p>

<p>And for some reason, when this was upsetting me so much the only person that I really thought about then was my grandmother.  And I was talking about it to MSCZ then and, and it just occurred to me now too, the way, when he's giving to me as he was most of the weekend, I, if I'm in this kind of state at all, I co—, I completely am unable to give to him.  I want him there and I want him to hold me in his arms but I can't return it.  And if he wants me to return it, there's just something that's, I just can't seem to do it.  And yet if he turns away, if, if he just gets so he's so upset by it or if he's just sick of it or whatever, then I can.  And there's something about my grandmother and what she meant to me that I guess I did feel she was the only one who really felt anything for me and accepted me as I was and returned any kind, or gave any kind of love.  (Sighs; pause) And I think the thing that has upset me about her dying is this feeling that I don't feel ready yet not to have somebody in my life who is, I guess, what traditionally is a mother, a mother role, and, or a parent role.  Because she's the only one that I felt that way about.  (Pause) And then it upsets me that I still have that need. (Silence)</p>

<p>It's funny.  For some reason I just, it's almost this feeling that I can't think about this anymore.  But I jumped again to something that happened today that was sort of — well, I'm not aware of having any emotional reaction to it unless there's an escape from thinking further on any of this.  And it was just a incident.  I had a, I received a Christmas card from a parent of a boy I'd had last year.  And it happened to be a parent that I had felt some amount of tension with last year.  But she, in a way she was always quite friendly and in a way I always liked her.  And I met her when I left the school and, and just mentioned the fact that I'd received the card and thanked her.  And I can't see why I'd start thinking about that.  Unless that it was that I was sort of surprised that she sent a card to me this year.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And I just realized, too, that, uhm, several days ago I received a card from my assistant.  And it's true that often it didn't, I didn't remember I'd gotten it at times when I could talk to her, thank her for it but I still found there was something about saying that I'd gotten it and making some comment about it and thanking her that, again, was, meant that we had some kind of an intimate relationship.  And I, I felt very awkward and I had to kind of make myself do it.  And it took me several days before I could.  And I would tell myself well, I just don't seem to be remembering it at times when I can bring it up but then it began to seem it was just an excuse not to have to say anything.  And it seems like an awfully silly thing to not be able to say something about.  But somehow there is some kind of a feeling of intimacy, as far as I see, acknowledging having received it to the person directly.  And I can't remember, but I don't think I was able to look at her when I said it.  I think I was busy doing something and I, that might have been the only reason why I found I could bring it up.  Because I didn't have to look at her then when I said it.</p>

<p>And this is another thing that this weekend I was, or I'd just been thinking about generally lately: how little I do look at people if the feeling I have is one of intimacy, whatever is happening, I just want to get away from it, even with MSCZ.  And if I do look at people just simply in a conversation or something it's almost as if I'm doing it consciously.  I'm always aware that I'm doing it and it's not just an act—, natural thing.  And I don't know whether I could do it if the conversation were on anything but the broadest and generalest (sic) topics.  And, of course, that's just like my father, whom I've always loved, because he is always ducking his head and never looking at people.  And it would seem I do practically the same thing, not quite so bad because I'm more aware of it.  But the same feeling is behind it. (Pause)</p>

<p>And I don't know whether this is true of everybody in my family but I was just thinking, I had to call home last night to get some addresses and my parents were out and I got my brother.  And I think at that point I found it, I always find it hard to call at home and usually I'll wait till it's absolutely essential.  And last night I kind of gotten myself prepared for it.  And I assumed I I'd be talking to my mother and I thought I could handle that one alright.</p>

<p>But she wasn't home and I talked to my brother.  And I was thinking how awkward things were and how much I just didn't want to talk and how much I wanted to end the conversation.  But yet here it was my brother and I felt I should have something to say to him.  And I don't know whether he had the same feeling in return but it was actually the feeling I have when I have to talk to any of my family on the phone except for my sister, FNA.  And then it's more feeling that she's going on and on talking.  And, or maybe it's just that there's an even exchange, I don't know.  But it's just so much awkwardness on the phone and I'm, it's probably true of our relationships everywhere and it just comes out more when we're on the phone.  And then my mother returned the call.  And I didn't, I had gone to bed and I just used that as an excuse for not taking the call.  And it made me feel guilty in a way that it w—, here it was my mother calling and I wasn't going to talk to her.  But all I needed was a little excuse and then I could avoid doing it. (Pause)</p>

<p>But again I was just thinking it's not always that it's that way.  It just, I guess, depends, at least for my side of it, on how much I'm interested in them and what they're doing.  Because I can think of sometimes when I've called them when I've been very happy to hear from them and know what's happening to them and have things to tell them.  But then there are other times when I just feel our lives are so separate and I don't have much of any desire to have them anything else but separate.  (3-minute silence)</p>

<p>I just thought of another aspect of what I was feeling when I was upset on Saturday.  And it surprised me, the intensity of the feeling.  I may have admitted feeling that way before but feeling so unhappy about myself and what I am and, and really just being kind of well, despising myself, I'd never felt so strongly that I'd like to just hurt myself as I did.</p>

<p>ANALYST: What did you think of doing?</p>

<p>PATIENT:  Well, I feel ridiculous saying it now (laughs) but I just wanted to whip myself.  It was sort of a combination of feeling self-pity but on the other hand having absolutely no feeling for myself.  I think I could have, I could have been very rough with myself and not almost even felt it.  Or else, if I had hurt myself it would have felt good in some way.  (Pause) And at the thought of, well, the way I was feeling I couldn't, I just felt so nauseated that the thought of food was disgusting.  And then I sort of enjoyed the thought of losing weight till I wasted away till nothing, as if that would be some kind of self punishment. (Silence)</p>

<p>And something that MSCZ said, because of the way I was dwelling on all this, sort of bothered me.  And generally we've come to the feeling that it's not very good for us to talk about how we approach analysis because seems there are differences.  And it, I don't know how it affects him to talk about it but it just confuses me.  But at one point he was just trying to say that it wasn't going to do me any good just to go over it and over it or try to analyze what had happened or why or what I could do.  And in a way I could agree with him but in another way it, I couldn't tell how much that's just the way my mind works or how much I was making it do that.  And whatever it was, that was what I wanted to do at that time.  And so initially my reaction was, "But you're wrong, for me it's not wrong."  And then, because it was somebody else having a different opinion, I began to become very unsure.  (Pause)</p>

<p>And so that today, for instance, when I, well, the word I would choose today would be "concentrating" on something and trying to analyze whatever it is that's in my mind so I can put words to it, I begin to become unsure then and think maybe I'm just doing more of dwelling on it.  And, and also on Saturday and Sunday, more Saturday night but Sunday too, I couldn't tell how much I was dwelling on it or how much I was just trying to refine how I was feeling or refine it in my mind so I could understand what it was that were my reactions.  (2-minute silence)</p>

<p>And I can't remember in what context I mentioned this the other day but just occurred to me again.  Thinking about how my — well, I guess it might have been a comparison to my, the probable relationship of my grandmother and my grandfather.  But I was thinking of my, how my father treated my mother so much and how, no matter how critical he was of us or how many, well, violent or unpleasant things he said to us it was never the way he talked to my mother, it was never as bad as what he would do with my mother.  And, I don't know, when I mentioned this before I had a more clear feeling about it but somehow I can still understand that this must have had a lot to do with my not wanting to be a woman (pause) or be submissive or whatever I thought being a woman was, or passive.</p>

<p>ANALYST: Well, our time's up.</p>

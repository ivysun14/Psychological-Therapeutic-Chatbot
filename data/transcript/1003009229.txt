<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Thanks.  How are you?  Oh, you'll have to sit there, I put you in a different spot.  I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I never realized there's a little fire safety thing in here [INAUDIBLE] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're seeing it from a different angle.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Your office.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You can sit there if you want.  Wherever you're comfortable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, this is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, this is fine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I had the test done at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I got the results back on Tuesday, they called me, and I so securely [INAUDIBLE] that day I thought, oh, they're going to call me and tell me that everything's fine, but they didn't.  The nurse called me and she said that, um, they considered any test result below 5 to be significantly, um, human growth hormone deficient and I had had, uh, uh, you know, I've been getting Dopamine, 500 mg, and blood drawn every half hour for 2 hours and she said, um, the highest reading you had was 0.6.  She said, you're, you're one of the worse cases we've seen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So she said, we're going to start, um, with the, the human growth hormone injections.  So, it will be delivered to the house and then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, that will explain the tiredness in part, right?  Or maybe completely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It's a lot more than just that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The depression, the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It's all associated with it, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, so they're going to do that, um, I have to learn how to give myself injections every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you nervous about doing that, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, no, actually, I'm relieved.  So maybe that will be the answer but -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You'll feel better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and that's, that's exactly what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], who I saw down in Texas, now he gave me this test and said I was borderline.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Borderline when you did it?  How many years ago was that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Two thousand four.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, I think we're relating it to the, partially in 2004 to the pituitary gland.  It's just not kicking out enough human growth hormone and it can't control the thyroid hormone either, so this is, this is all in his book about, you know, he thinks like a third of the people who have fibromyalgia have a pituitary disorder.  It says, you have to measured for it.  He talks about it causing a deficiency, you know, damage to the pituitary gland, which my MRI has shown, it could cause a deficiency in growth hormones, thyroid hormones and sex hormones, which all mine are, have been really low.  Um, he said, um, patients become very fatigued and have significant deterioration of attention, concentration, learning abilities, memory, problem solving, even language.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Which you have.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And, uh, it says expand, expanding research has shown the deficiency can cause muscle weakness, impaired cognition, decreased muscle mass, which I have all of that too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Decreased muscle mass.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, muscle fatigue.  Um, he says, treatment, daily injections of drugs will not only improve your energy, stability in motion, in cognition, it will make your muscles stronger, it will make you lose fat, it will improve levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.  I don't have a problem with that.  It will also improve your bone density.  I do have a problem with that.  My calcium levels are too low.  He says, after 2 months of treatment, your deficiency, it says, your depression will lift.  It's an atypical depression that comes with it.  This is exactly what that psychiatrist down in Texas told me.  He said, have you have it checked, and I said yes.  So, um, he said growth hormone treatment helps thyroid hormone to work better, um, and efficiently, and promotes good skin health.  He said, however, it can cause carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral swelling, joint pains and swelling -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and high blood sugar.  If you're receiving growth hormone treatment, avoid taking oral estrogens.  Oral estrogens may lessen the body composition.  Benefits of the treatment, and it says, 3 months of a growth hormone therapy is generally enough to make you feel better from the treatment.  If you do, you may need to continue the treatment for a long time.  According to research, growth hormone treatment over a 10 year period seems to be safe enough.  So he goes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You seem relieved more than anything.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I am relieved.  I think cutting down on the Luvox has helped too.  I mean, I'm, I'm probably going through some withdrawal from that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How is that helping?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'm more, uh, I'm more alert.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It hasn't taken away the fatigue or anything.  Uh, I'm having rough problems with digestion and I talked to, uh, [NAME OTHER] out at, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't know if you know him, the compounding pharmacist out there.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And he told me to take, uh, [INAUDIBLE], and he said, you know, this explains why when you took that class of risperidone drugs, he said, it was like killing your brain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You didn't have enough dopamine to begin with.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, um, he's the one who kind of came to my rescue when I was on that Trileptal and I had the, the hypometria thing and I was in the hospital for 3 days, and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, hopefully we'll be able to get you even off the Luvox then if this works.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It takes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're taking the Klonopin too, so -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You're not taking that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, because I had, I tried taking that sublingual one and it really made me more anxious and I think it's that phenyl amolin or whatever it is in it.  My doctor thought, so he said, you know, if you need to take it just take it regular.  But I've always been very drug sensitive and last weekend, I went across the street to a neighbors and he has a home theater.  We were watching a movie and I, I don't drink, I can't drink, it makes me very sick, and I had a little wine, like that, mixed with water.  I was up all night vomiting.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh geez.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I had such reflux I couldn't control it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And finally, you know, I just vomited everything up 2 or 3  times and then I felt better, but, um, as he says too, the, the, the parathyroid, the, uh, pituitary gland also, the human growth hormone also affects the adrenal glands and, um, um, you know, the thyroid and the whole business.  My father couldn't drink either.  It made him very sick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So usually, I've read that that's associated with the, you know, adrenal glands are very sensitive to that.  So a problem solved.  We've had to put up with all of us.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's interesting isn't it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's interesting to see your reaction.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Your reaction is -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I've told doctors, I don't know for how many years -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You didn't know what was going on, but so now at least it's identified.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, the headaches, I mean -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Plus, it's treatable, which is good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean, there may be some side effects, but I'd rather have 10 good years than 20 lousy ones.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And, how quickly will you start feeling benefits, or it varies?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> They said 3 months.  And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] says, and I should get in touch with him, um, he says in 2 months the depression should lift.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But that's what that psychiatrist down, his name was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], down in, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], said to me when I went in to see him.  He said, "Have you had your, your growth hormone checked?"  And I had like 2 years before, and he said, "When you don't sleep, you, it goes both ways.  You don't produce enough human growth hormone, or, if you don't produce enough human growth hormone, you don't sleep."  And he said, "I've, um, what your describing, your type of depression," he says, "I've had it described time and time again."  He says that it sounds like human growth hormone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> What specifically did you say that made him -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He says, people feel like their life is over.  That they've lived it.  You know, and there's nothing else to live for.  You know, they're usually, um, their children are grown, that kind of thing, and they just, it's just, that kind of a depression.  You know, they just feel hopeless, and, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Despair?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Despair.  Which you felt, but the ag, what about the agitation?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But the, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because when you first came, you seemed very aggravated.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it, I think it was the estrogen level being low and then -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I think it was all the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The combination.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Excuse the expression, all the crap they had me on.  All those pharmaceutical things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, I was on so much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And then I think the doctor's weren't listening to me.  I don't know how many times I've been hospitalized and they, anything that affects dopamine -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Is making it worse.  Anything that was, uh, like Remeron, especially, or Cymbalta, any of those, I think, I don't know if it's norepinephrine or what, but they were just, I don't think my system had enough time to get rid of the stuff that I'd been given.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I think it was a combination of withdrawal from that and being given so many, I mean, just like that, I just kept popping one thing at a, one thing after another.  And that's what the 2 psychiatrists said.  They said I never met anyone who's been on so many drugs in such a short period of time in my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, and she said, you know, we often see patients in a state of agitation when that's the exposure that they've been given.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, I think we should be hesitant though until, maybe wait a couple of months then before we start lowering the Luvox any further.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I'm down to 150.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Fifty, yeah.  Let's keep the 150 for a period of time.  Just see, you know, how you start feeling better over a 2 month period.  Plus, that will get us out of the winter anyway.  Winter is tough time for depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I tried taking the progesterone and it, I must say, it made me worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It did?  What happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> That, I had taken it the week before and then I was so sick with the acid reflux and everything, and, uh, my family doctor said, he said, "I don't," he's not real crazy about hormones anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, we talked about that.  You did talk to him about it though?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right, he said -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Because you can't, you can't be on unopposed estrogen, you need to take progesterone, at least the part of the month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  He said I would, he said I would sign off on you for a, a transdermal, but not an oral -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I gave you a transdermal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, for the estrogen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But for the, uh, I was taking Prometrium for the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh, oh, I see.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> But there is a transdermal one that you can have compounded.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want to try, did he give you a prescription for that, or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, he's not really that familiar with how much to order or anything like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he doesn't prescribe them usually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, we have to do the equivalent and see if, well, usually you want to, if you do it 14 days a month, the equivalent of 200 mg of the Prometrium.  Um -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I was only taking 100 mg Prometrium.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> One hundred, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> From you too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you, you, when you talk to the pharmacist, in terms of the equivalency, you know, the compounding pharmacy, and he'll put it together for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then, you know, usually they do 200s though, not 100.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, well, I can ask [NAME OTHER], because he, I was actually on -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, if you want to just do it half a month, then, right, 14 days a month?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That's fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll ask about it because he tried -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But the equivalency of 200 Prometrium is what I would want to put you on a -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I was going nuts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Increased anxiety or -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, with him I was on transdermal thyroid hormone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh no.  I mean, when you took the Prometrium, what you were feeling?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I took, uh, an oral dose of 60 mg, um, in 2004, and I did, I, and that comes along with the human growth hormone deficiency too, you put on weight in the middle, you know, you put on a lot of weight, and it, and, as they say -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> That goes along with thyroid problems too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, see, the pituitary gland has just been freaking out.  The thyroid, that's a good way to put it because I had a thyroid [INAUDIBLE] releasing hormones test down in Texas and it showed that the pituitary gland was, um, uh, was, um, was not alert.  You know, because it couldn't, because of the thyroid hormone that I had to be given way too much for one thing, and it had suppressed it, and that's why [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was saying to me that, uh, your pituitary gland is so sensitive, he said, if you're getting anymore thyroid hormone than it really wants, it's shutting down and it's getting, um, if it's not getting -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, it wasn't regulating properly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's taking the TSH way up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's why this endocrinologist kept saying to me, "We can't control your TSH, it's here, it's there, it's up, it's down."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right, right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I said, he says, you know, "You're going crazy, I'm going crazy, we're all going crazy."  And he said it's got to be -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Something else.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> The pituitary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And several years ago when I was over at [DEIDENTIFIED], [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] there, who the ear, nose and throat doctor sent me to, the endocrinologist, said to me then she said, I think your pituitary problem and it's out of my league.  She sent me to [DEIDENTIFIED] to see a doctor there, who I waited 6 months to get in to see, he was some old fellow in his 80s, and I sat there and talked to him for an hour about this.  I had all my test results and everything else, and he really had, he said, "Well, your test results are coming in normal."  And I said, well, "I don't think they're normal."  And I said, I, you know, I feel like I'm going to pass out.  Dizziness is a part of this, low blood pressure is a big part of this.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I had that going on with the aldosterone problem and, uh, he just kind of looked at me and I said, "You're not listening to anything I'm saying to you.  You just think I'm a crazy post menopausal woman."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You said that to him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And he didn't say anything and I looked at him and I said, "Well, if you think that," I said,  "then our conversation is over and I'm wasting my time and your time."  And I got up and left, and then he charged me $600.00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that, uh, that's another thing that, um, he talks about my low iron reserves, which I have, and I called another doctor, Doctor, I can't remember his name, it started with an F at the [DEIDENTIFIED] who wrote articles, and I told him, I said, "My ferritin level is too low, can you test me?"  He said, "Oh, I've never heard of that," he said.  And I said, "Well, um, you know, I'm, I, then I have to go out to California and see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] out there and have it tested."  He said, "Well, I think that's a good idea."  I mean, the attitude, and it was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], [DEIDENTIFIED] who wrote all the text books on thyroid who tells me it's my thyroid hormone, when my pituitary gland was shutting down and when I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] down in Texas, he's a very quite doctor and, uh, he said to me, kind of looked out the corner, like this, and he said, "How is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?"  And I said, uh, I said, "He retired, thank God."  And I said, how could he have done this to me?  How could he have gotten my thyroid level so high that my pituitary was shutting down?  My TSH is coming at a 0.015.  And he, and then he looked at me and said, "Well, he was a brilliant researcher in his time, but not a good doctor."</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, [DEIDENTIFIED] knew his reputation too, and then [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], they were trying to suppress the thyroid, give me so much thyroid, they were trying to suppress the thyroid thinking that I wouldn't, the nodules wouldn't turn into something else and they said, you know, there's no basis for that.  It's a very old way of thinking, it causes a lot of problems with the pituitary gland, and I'm like, could I have gone to worse doctors.  And then, they don't listen to you, and then they give you risperidone, which causes the pituitary problems.  A lot of lawsuits with that drug with the causing swelling of the pituitary gland.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Risperdal.  Actually, in Great Britain they've outlaws Zyprexa, it's no longer available.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It has a lot of side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And that's what [NAME OTHER] was saying.  He's seeing more and more of this too.  And I think Risperdal will come off the market.  I think eventually it's going to come off.  So, Texas is suing Johnson & Johnson now for $600 million over it.  So, and that's what, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] came up with their studies, it causes slowing of the pituitary gland, problems, and then [DEIDENTIFIED] issued a warning about using it in post menopausal women because it really lowers estrogen and it can be permanent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you've spent so much energy and time researching this.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because I could get no answers, and I was angry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I mean, this was like over night that all of this started with me.  You know, all this psychiatric bizarre stuff, and it just didn't make any sense.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, but he goes -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> You sound angry.  You sound more angry now than you've sounded -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Well, I, I said, I said to my family doctor when I saw him and I got the results back and he just, you know, kept telling me that it's anxiety and, um, then with my heart problem, I'd seen a psychiatrist who told me, you know, I was getting the -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Micro [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, the air in from the lung into the carotid artery into the brain, which that's a good way to get infections, you know, when you have an infection in the lung, and, um, it was her husband who's a neurologist who diagnosed it and she said, "People with that condition have an awful lot of anxiety."  And she said, "I can't treat it until after the PFO closure is done."  Because she said, "What I think is happening is, um, the blood circulates but it's not always clearing the liver and you can become toxic on any drugs you're taking or, uh, you know, infections."  And, um, I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] out in [DEIDENTIFIED], great doctor.  He's like one of [DEIDENTIFIED]'s top 10 doctors.  And I went into see him and he, he told me, you know, "You have a, a thrush infection and other things."  He's actually an immunologist.  And when I found out I had the PFO [INAUDIBLE], he gave me his home phone number and I called him at home a couple of times.  And he says, "You have a tremendous amount of anxiety."  And I said,  "I know."  He says, "Your thyroid hormone numbers seem to be coming in all right, so there's something else going on here."  So when I found out about the heart thing and I called him and he said, uh, he said, you know, you, you, "Your system has been open to a lot of infection with that going on."  He says, because he said the same thing, the blood does not always clear the liver, and I don't have an appendix and I don't have tonsils, and he said, so you're more prone to infection in your system.  Um, you know, your system will more easily become toxic on medications and things like that.  And he says, why is your, "What does your, uh, internist think about this, your MD?"  And I said, "He tells me it's only anxiety."  Do you know what he said to me?  He said, "The son of a bitch."  He says "It's doctor's like that who set medicine back 100 years."  So, when I saw my doctor this week, who I like, and he's, he has a beautiful bedside manner, and I said, I said to him, "I'm angry."  And he said, "You have a right to be."  He says, "If you'd like to punch me or hit me with a pillow or tennis racket," he says, "Go ahead."  So anyway, we'll see what happens now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So, it helps to get some of the anger out?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It does.  And it's like, my family didn't get it because they thought I was -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> How does your husband feel now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> He's not saying much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Because he, you know, he was very negative and kind of angry all the time when I say the way I feel, then when I was in the hospital that -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> So he's more quiet huh?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Well, when I was in the hospital last time, you know, was on the IV and had the hypometria, after the psychiatrist hung up on me and told me she knew these drugs and it couldn't be happening, and then, thank God, the pharmacist kind of to save my life and then I went to my doctor and I, he admitted me immediately because it was like, I couldn't stand up.  I couldn't think, I couldn't, I didn't remember how I got there.  Um, my husband came to the hospital he says, there's no reason for you to be in here.  He says, "It's just an anxiety disorder."  He says, "You've got to do something about it.  It's ruined your life and every, and everybody else's in the family."  And he's yet to say I'm sorry.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Hm.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, I'm a little angry with him.  But I have neighbors who have been very supportive, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Good.  And your kids?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I don't think they get it yet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it's, uh, it's been hell.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping at night now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> A little better.  I, uh, it was my son's birthday and last night we went out to, uh, dinner.  I made him a birthday dinner for him the night before, um, we went out last night and we got home around 10:00.  I, my son, I just picked my son up at the airport before we left, he came in from [DEIDENTIFIED] and he was really fatigued, but the neighbors came over and they were all in the kitchen, um, eating snacks and drinking when we got home.  So, uh, it was like 3:00 in the morning before I went to bed, and I really was tired.  But -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And you're able to sleep then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> It, it's better.  I still have the really bizarre, vivid dreams and things going on.  And it's like [NAME OTHER] says, though, she thinks this is all medical at this point.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> At this point, yeah, you need to wait and see you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, and she says, I don't really know if there's anything that I can do to help you other than talking to you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> No, talking helps.  [LAUGHING].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, it does.  And, um, so I, uh, I'll see in a couple of weeks, but, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I wouldn't, like I say, at this point I wouldn't make anymore changes with the medicine except finding out about the transdermal, you know, the transdermal progesterone because we need to use that and find out dose wise, and you know, I'll give him the dose and then we'll just keep you on that, and then in a couple of months we'll kind of assess.  If you're feeling significantly better, what we'll do is we'll go down to 100 Luvox, and we'll gradually get you off it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I'd like to get off of it.  I think it does -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I don't know about the estrogen.  We'll see about the estrogen down the road, but for the next couple of months, let's -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I don't know, yeah, I don't know if the human -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It may.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> It may, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Then I would.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> When do you see him again?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, they told me, human growth hormone is a controlled substance.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you have to get it from them?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, it will be sent to the office by the pharmaceutical company.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And, uh, they told me I should have it by Monday.  Now, they called me on Tuesday and they said if not, call them, but they'll call me as soon as they get it and they'll work me in and show me how to use it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how many times a week?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Everyday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Everyday, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> So, at this point, but, uh, this doctor [INAUDIBLE] endocrinologists and when I saw a psychiatrist down there he immediately sent over a psychiatrist.  He said, he said, I don't know what's going on with you, but, you know, you, you need to have this treated.  You're going to -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, there's so much overlap between the mind and the body, and I think in your case we need to see what improvement we have physically and how that affects your emotional state.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> After seeing so many psychiatric wards, I'm convinced at least 50% to 75% of what I see in there is endocrine problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, you might be right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And it's, there are endocrine psychiatrists, but only a few.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Like at [DEIDENTIFIED] and places like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Where?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] and -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well like I say, at this point, you know, you're, I think you're definitely more angry but less anxious I'm sure, if that helps, you're less anxious, right?  You're able to exercise or do you want to wait to, wait -</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> No, I can't exercise.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Wait a while, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> And I say to my doctor, you know, "I can only, I can't even take 3 plates out of the dishwasher without shaking," and he would say, "Oh, it's just because you're, you know."  I think he thought it was all in my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well, let's see.  It's a gradual change over the say, next 2 to 3 months, so, but, let's get this straightened out for next month with the progesterone, that's important.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> I'll call [NAME OTHER] and see how much he thinks I should -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Yeah, and then let's go and keep you on 14 days a month.  And then, other than that, do you need refills on anything else like the Luvox?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, I think you only gave me a month refill on the, uh, estrogen.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> I did, oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  So, um -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Do you want another refill, or do you want to wait and see me before?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Um, you know, I'll see what [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] says because he measured my DHEA and some other things and when I go in I really do want to talk about, you know, what should I be taking, what should not with the human growth hormones right now, straighten out some of these other problems I kind of doubt it -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Well, when are you going to see him?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> As soon as the, uh -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> The growth hormone comes in.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> You know, I get that.  He said, they said I should have it by Monday, and I haven't gotten it yet, so -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> All right, well, you have the estrogen for you, it's just been what, a week or so, or has it been 2 weeks since we got the prescription?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Uh, it's been about a week, but I've been on it for a few months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Okay, all right, so you have enough for 3 more weeks.  So why don't I see you within the 3 week time.  All right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay, and just go ahead and have the progesterone, have [NAME OTHER] figure out what it is he thinks -</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> And then to call me and I'll approve it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> But you want to do that 14 days a month.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b> Right.  I do think getting off the Luvox might help with my [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b> Let's not, let's not do that now.  Let's leave the 150 for now.</p>

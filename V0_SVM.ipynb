And my feelings just kind of being on the outside of where, you know, every time I bring up my concerns and my needs and my wants, and you know (voice breaks) my hopes. It always turns back to, well now you are hurting my feelings, my needs and my wants.' And I guess I'm kind of stuck at the crossroads there, where again, I don't, I guess this is part of the communication aspect of it. But I just get so frustrated and so down on myself because I don't really know what else I can do. You know, I feel like I'm putting a lot out there, just putting myself out there, just putting my feelings out there and letting them be known. To try to explain to them how I am feeling, how it does bother me. And to be honest, I think, you know, I get, I hesitate away from it because ultimately, you know the outcome's been the same for a long time. And that's always been one of negativity. \",\n",

And a hurt that I know what I'm doing is right, but the whole time it bothers me. The whole time, it affects, you know, how I feel as a person. It affects how I feel, you know, as, as, as a son. As someone who is supposed to be loved and support his parents. And here I am going against them. Here I am fighting them, and it just, it angers me that I don't, I don't have a solid grasp on where my relationship is with them. You know, I don't have a solid grasp on how to communicate with them. \",\n",
       "  \" No, and they haven't. That's the major difference, is they haven't. They've always, you know in my mind, they've always listened to me, they've always, you know nurtured me, and helped me and made me feel like I was, you know, worth something. You know, they were the ones that never talked back. They never diverted, you know pushed me to the side. They never criticized me about anything. They never, you know, made me feel guilty. You know, I, and, and, it's frustrating because I know they are bad. I know they are bad. I know the effects they can have on me. But yet, I still feel, safe with them, and I don't know why. I still feel like it's something I can rely on. From doing so in the past, that's never really hurt me. It's hurt me once when I overdosed, but not mentally. They've hurt my physically. And I can't, you know explain how the emotional side of doing the drugs and the feeling that it makes me. Because I do forget a lot of things. I do feel like I become, when I am in the zone, when I can, you know when I'm in full positivity. I'm in a place where everyone, you know, I only care about me. And I have no regards to the outside world or anybody else. \",\n",
       "  \" When I hurt them. When I, you know, my actions, you know, hurt people. And I feel like I'm disappointing them, because I, I shouldn't be doing that. I shouldn't be this negative towards things. I shouldn't, I shouldn't react, you know the way I react to things. I want to be that loving, caring person, who, who's there to help. Who's not masking, or putting on a smiley face for all the stuff that's bothering them. You know, the most disappointing part is I feel like I'm disappointing myself as, as a human being. I'm disappointing myself in making decisions that are rash and harsh. And after I make them, even though I know that they've already been done, that the guilt comes in. And instead of, you know, pursuing that, you know, I feel disappointed that I let them down. That I let them down. That I let people down, because people have high expectations of me. At least I feel that way, and I have high expectations of myself. And when I go and get tugged back, by whatever it is that I do, or whatever somebody else does, I just, I just beat myself up over it. \",\n",
       "  \" It's something but, the people that I, I've used this one before, it's like when you get all A's on your report card, right? And you come home, and the first thing you want to do is show your parents. And just, to show them like, how good you did, and that's how, you know you are a student, and you are very proud of yourself. Well, the two people that I want to show, and impress, never seem impressed. And that's the difficult part. You know. The two people who's opinion that I really want, and really desire, I cant get one. I mean I get one, but it's not, it's not a yay or a negative one. It's just a, Okay, and that's it. I mean it's great that I do have the support that I have, but there's also that other support that I, that I crave. That I just want. That I just need. And, I, I am running out of ways to ask for it. TO have them embrace it? Will the wedding be the ticket? I don't know. Do I have my hopes up? Yes. But I don't know, I don't understand how it can be, because I can't even have a conversation about it, without me getting irritated and them getting irritated because we have two different views of it. And that, and that's what really drives my up the wall. \",\n",
       "  \" I can, I absolutely could. And we talked about it. But then I, I felt bad because I know how much they want to participate in it. I know how much they want to be involved because it is their first child getting married. And then comes in to the guilt where I, I originally wanted that because then I could delegate what they could and couldn't do. You know, it was the control thing coming in to play. Where now, all of the sudden I have all of the control. But then, you know, my fiance' really wanted a couple of things and you know, unfortunately her mother said she'd help out but not to the extent. And you know, I kind of got, you know, persuaded to allowing them to participate. \",\n",
       "  \" When we made the decision to let them be a part and contribute to the wedding. We made it based on, pretty much, you know, what her mother wasn't going to be able to cover. I knew from the start my dad was adamant about having open bar. So we had that option. The other part with the food was, it was only going to be a couple things. You know, we were only going to get the basic packages, all affordable, you know that we could handle. However, we talked about our future, and not spending all our savings on the wedding. So we are looking at this as a gift, from my parents, as a you know, as a wedding present is to contribute to it. And the decision behind it was, well we'll let them control it, because that's pretty much what they care about. Because that's all they talk about is the food and the booze. So we said, we decided on this together that we would allow it to happen. However, you know, when we did let them do it, I didn't understand what was going to come after it. And that's when it started, you know the list started growing. \",\n",
       "  \" Well I knew that it was coming, and that was my one fear in letting them do it. Because I knew these other perks were coming. I knew, and I explained this to my fiance'. I knew all these threats were coming. You know, and ultimately she was the one who, you know, we talked and we agreed to it. But now that we're demanding the lists and the revisions and all the stuff, I can't get it. I'm getting pushed off to the side, it's being diverted and deflected. I've been asking for over a month, for a revised list. The last time I checked, they were only allowed to invite 80 to 85 people total. Well last time I checked it was up to 95. And I went off on them. I said, what is going on here? Why can't you respect the number that I put on the list. Why do you keep pushing the buttons, pushing the envelope. I mean ultimately I'm going to be the one who nixes people off their list. I'm going to be the one who says no, this person's not coming. But, I'm the one who's going to be challenged. I'm the one who's going to be like well you have to do this, who is going to be told, well you have to do this. You need to invite this one, because of this one. I don't need to do anything. \",\n",
       "  ' No, I agree. ',\n",

       "  \" I have. Because I do want it to be a, a nice event. I do want it to be a beautiful event. You know, because I know what I can afford, and what the even will look like. As opposed to, with a little help, the event will be a little bit better than what I can provide. You know, and it's more of a, I want to please her, too. Because it's her dream. It's her dream wedding, and it's her dream venue and this is what she wants. However we are talking about the strings that are attached, you know. There are certain strings that I'm going to accept. There's actually a lot of them that I'm going to accept. But, the one thing I won't accept is when I tell the caterer, like when I'm doing all the negotiating with the caterer, we're picking the food, we're picked the hors d'oeuvres, we're picking the total number of people. You know, when I make those decisions, basically all I'm doing is using their money. And I want to keep them involved in what's going on. I want to let them know that this is part of the procedure. However, when I get them involved in the decision making, well, then, my mind gets three or four different decisions and I can't make a decision. I can't make a decision because I really like this. But then they want this too, so I want to have that but, I, I can't do this and then she wants this, and, and it's to the point where it's, you know, where do I compromise? \",\n",
       "  \" There is, because that's what I want to do. I want to have the resources to make her, you know to make her dream wedding. \",\n",

       "  \" Well not money, I'm just talking about,  my dream wedding is a great place, with great people, and a great atmosphere, that's mine. Whether it's indoors, outdoors, whatever. But I kind of look at it as a fancy party. Where everybody dresses up and celebrates something big. Kind of, you know, that's my dream wedding. My dream wedding is, and I've had this since I got engaged, is like hosting a party at the White House. Is everybody's there for one reason, and that is to celebrate something. But everybody is formal, everybody is polite, and every body is kind of on the same page. They are all happy. That's my dream wedding. That's my dream wedding. Her dream wedding is fancy flowers, ton's of people, just not having any disasters. My parent's dream wedding, and this is, you know, the problem is, there is my dream wedding, there's her dream wedding, there's my parent's dream wedding and her mom's dream wedding.  So there's four dream weddings that we have to combine in to one. And unfortunately, I'm having a problem compromising, you know, with all these dreams. Because there's a lot of stuff in my dream wedding that my fiance' wants. But there's a lot of stuff that her mother wants, that I can't see, she can't see, but makes a stink over. There's a lot of stuff that my parent's want, that I can't see, she can't see, and they're making a stink over. But the problem is, her mom has financial ties to it, my parent's have financial ties to it, I have financial ties to it. So there's three separate incomes that are coming in to this, and everybody wants their piece of the pie. And I am beyond frustrated because I don't, (sighs) I'll compromise, but I don't want to compromise all the way. And that's, that's, that's the dilemma that I'm in. That's the decisions that you know, we're, I'm facing, she's facing, our parent's are facing. Because we're all, got our agendas. We all have certain things that we want to check off that we need to have. Well, the things I need to have are the things my parent's need to have too. But the things that I don't want are the things that my parent's need. And that's, that's where the guilt comes in, that's where the frustration comes in. That's where me trying to communicate about, you know, I know you want this and this, but I don't want this and this. Or I don't need this and this. Let's have a conversation as to why we need it. And the conversation starts and then after five minutes it dilutes. It goes away. \",\n",
       "  ' Yeah. ',\n",
       "  \" Exactly. It's how I feel, I feel like I get no where. I feel like my opinion doesn't matter. And, and, the whole, issue is, I just want to talk about it. It's a start for me, I just want to talk about it. I just want to have a conversation and listen without anybody yelling and screaming and tuning out. I just, and they've never done this since I can remember. They've never sat down and talked to me. They've never sat down and listened. It's always this is what you are going to do, if you don't like it, too fucking bad. Or it's a, why do you have to do it this way, why do you have to be difficult? Why can't you just suck it up and move on, and pretend that everything is okay? Or suck it up and stop causing this controversy. In a way, and I say this, about my mother, is that my mother doesn't like anything negative talked about her family or her children. But when I overdosed, when my brother got his DUI, when my other brother was, you know, in to drugs and all his credit card debt. She was pissed that everybody was talking about us and how bad we were. However, one of my cousins got busted for drugs, one of my cousins got busted for OUI, when my cousins all got arrested, she was the first one to talk smack to everybody. She was the first one to criticize them, like what the hell's wrong with them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. \",\n",
       "  \" Yeah, you know. I don't want to, I don't want to hurt you. But I also want to have a conversation with you, and when you go into a shell and start crying and start blaming you know, yourself for how I feel. There's no, I can't get through. Because then you just start beating yourself up and then I feel guilty as all hell, and I'm like, maybe I shouldn't have crossed that road. \",\n",
       "  \" No. No. That wasn't the intention. The intention was to get it off my chest, to have the conversation. To basically just, relay to them what I'm feeling. And how, we can work together to compromise and fix it. But instead it's, it turns out as an attack on them. Me attacking people. And then, again, it goes into the vicious cycle of running in the wheel. Where I feel like ah shit, now what did I do? You know? Now I have to revert and come back and, and, and apologize for what I said, and put on the smiley face again, that nothing's wrong. There's no issues that need to be tackled. And I can't do that anymore. I really can't. That's the most frustrating part about it. Everything is like that. It's like, it's repetitious, every time I go and revisit old wounds and bring up what I want to talk about and how I'm feeling and how I feel about this, that and the other person. It's always redirected to how they are feeling. And it's always to the point to divert it so the conversation ends so they don't have to deal with it. And I don't know what they are running away from. \",\n",
       "  \" Is it? It' pisses me off. \",\n",
       "  \" It's difficult, because I do feel like that, I don't feel like that at my house now. I feel like there is someone there with open arms willing to listen and talk things out. And at home, I always get diverted, at my parent's, I always get diverted. And the same thing happens, you know, with my sister.
